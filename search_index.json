This book teaches basic coding skills, using the programming language Java and the development environment IntelliJ IDEA. The learning material covered in this book delivers the basic training that is needed for a furthermore in-depth study of programming and prepares the reader for the entrance exam at SoftUni.\n\nThis book only gives you the first steps to programming. It covers basic skills that you must develop for years, to reach a high enough level and start working as a programmer.\n\nThe book is used as unofficial textbook for school-level programming courses: in the high schools, studying professions like Programmer, Application Programmer and System Programmer, as well as an additional teaching tool in the initial programming courses at the secondary schools, mathematical and professional high schools.\nWho is this book intended for?\nThis book is suitable for absolute beginners in programming who want to try what programming is and learn the basic constructions for writing program code used in software development, regardless of the programming language and the technologies used. The book gives a solid basis of practical skills that you can use in any future training in programming and software development.\nFor anyone who hadn't passed the free course on Programming Basics in SoftUni, we specifically recommend enrolling it completely free, because programming is learned by code writing, not by reading! During the course you will get free access to lessons, explanations and demonstrations on-site or online (such as video tutorials), a lot of practice and code writing, help with the task solutions after each topic, instructors, assistants and mentors. Also, you will get free access to  forums and discussion groups for any questions, access to a community of thousands of people who are new in programming, and any other help that a beginner might need.\nThe free course for beginners in SoftUni is suitable for school students (of age 10+), university students and workers having any other professions. The course is suitable for everyone who want to gain technical knowledge and check if programming is what it will like to do and understand if they would like to develop in the software development field.\nA new group starts each month. The Programming Basics course at SoftUni is organized regularly using a few different programming languages as basis. So, check it out! This course is free, and you can quit any time you like. Signing up for free on-site or online training is available via the SoftUni application form: https://softuni.org.\nWhy did we choose java?\nFor this book, we choose the Java because it is a modern programming language for high-level programming, open-source, easy to learn, and suitable for beginners. Using Java is widespread, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries and technology frameworks, and accordingly, it gives many perspectives for development. Java combines paradigms of procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming in a modern way with easy syntax although it is more descriptive than Python and JavaScript. In this book, we will use Java language and IntelliJ IDEA development environment, which are available for free.\nAs we will explain later, the programming language that we start with, does not make a significant difference, but we still need to use some programming language, and in this book we choose Java specifically. The book can also be found mirrored in other programming languages such as C#  and JavaScript (see https://java-book.softuni.org).\nThe book in other programming languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C++\nThis book on programming for beginners is available in several programming languages (or is in the process of being adapted for them):\n\nProgramming Basics with C# (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with C# (English)\nProgramming Basics with Java (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with JavaScript (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with Python (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with C++ (Bulgarian)\n\nIf you prefer a different language, select it from the list above.\nProgramming is learned by a lot of writing, not reading!\nIf someone thinks it will read a book and learn to program without writing code and solving problems, this is a delusion. Programming needs a lot of practice, with code writing every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of tasks, seriously and persistently for years.\nYou need to: solve a lot of tasks, to make mistakes, to fix, to search for solutions and information from the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, to get used to the code, syntax, the programming language, the development environment, to search for errors and debugging the broken code, the algorithmic thinking, breaking the tasks into smaller parts, gaining experience and raising your skills every day, because when you learn to write code, this is only the first step to the profession of the \"software engineer\". You have a lot to learn!\nWe advise the reader, as a minimum, to try out all the examples from the book, to play with them, to change them, and test them. Even more important than the examples are the exercises because they develop the programmer's practical skills. This book provides nearly 150 practical coding exercises, so it is a good foundation for developing coding and algorithmic thinking skills.\nYou need to solve all the problems in the book because programming is learned with practice! The exercises after each topic are carefully selected to cover in-depth the learning material. The purpose of solving all the tasks is to provide complete set of skills for writing programming code at a beginners level (which is the purpose of this book). During the courses in SoftUni, we purposefully focus on practice and problem-solving, and in most courses, code writing occupies over 70% of the entire course.\n\n\nSolve all the exercises in the book. Otherwise you won't learn anything! Programming is learned by writing a lot of code and solving thousands of problems!\n\n\nAbout Software University (SoftUni)\nThe Software University (SoftUni) is the largest training center for software engineers in South-Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of students pass through the university every year. SoftUni was founded in 2014 as a continuation of the hard work of Dr. Svetlin Nakov in training skillful software engineering professionals by a practical, contemporary and high-quality education that combines fundamental knowledge with modern software technologies and a lot of practice.\nSoftUni: High-quality practical tech education\nThe Software University provides quality education, profession, job and diploma for programmers, software engineers and IT professionals. SoftUni builds an extremely successful and strong connection between education and industry by collaborating with hundreds of software companies, provides job and internships of its students, creates quality professionals for the software industry, and directly responds to the needs of employers via the training process.\nFree programming courses at SoftUni\nSoftUni organizes free programming courses for beginners: online and on-site in few locations. The purpose is to give a chance to everyone interested in programming and technologies to try programming, checks if they are interested and if they would get seriously involved in software development. You can sign up for the free course in programming basics using the SoftUni application page: https://softuni.org.\nThe free programming basics courses at SoftUni aim to introduce you to basic programming constructions in the software development world, that you can use in any programming language. These include working with data, variables and expressions, using conditional statements, constructing loops, defining and calling methods and other approaches for building programming logic. The trainings are highly practically oriented, which means that the emphasis is strongly on exercises, and you get the opportunity to apply your knowledge during the learning process.\nThis programming book accompanies the free programming lessons for beginners at SoftUni and serves as an additional teaching aid to help the learning process.\nThe automated Judge system\nThe SoftUni Judge system (https://judge.softuni.org) is an automated Internet system for checking the solutions of programming exercises via series of tests. The submission and verification happen in real-time: you submit the solution, and within seconds you get an answer whether it is correct. Each successfully taken test gives you the points it gains. For a completely correct solution, you get all the points for this problem. For a partially correct solution, you get part of the points for the task. For a completely wrong solution, you get 0 points.\nThis how the SoftUni Judge looks like:\nAll problems from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni judge, and we strongly recommend testing them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the task requirements.\nKeep in mind some specifics about SoftUni judge:\n\nFor each task the judge system keeps the best score you had. Therefore, if you upload a solution with the wrong code or a lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.\nThe output of your program is compared by the system to a strictly expected result. Every unnecessary symbol, missing comma, or space may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The output that the judge expects is described in the requirements of every task and nothing else should be added. \n\nExample: If the output requires printing a number (e.g. 25), do not display any descriptive messages such as The result is: 25. Print the output as it is required, i.e., only the number.\nThe SoftUni judge system is available any time via its website: https://judge.softuni.org.\n\nTo sign in, use your authentication for the SoftUni website: https://softuni.org.\nUsing the SoftUni system is free and it's not bound with the participation in SoftUni's courses.\n\nWe are convinced that after a few submitted tasks, you will like to receive instant feedback for your solutions, and the Judge system will become your favorite assistant in learning programming.\nHow to become a software developer?\nDear readers, probably many of you have the ambition to become programmers and develop software for a living or work in the IT area. That's why we have prepared for you a short guide on \"How to become a programmer\", so we can help you take the first steps towards this desired profession.\nYou can become a programmer (working in a software company) after at least 1-2 years of intensive training and coding every day, solving thousands of programming tasks, developing several more serious practical projects and gaining a lot of experience with code writing and software development. You can't become a programmer for a month or two! The profession of software engineer requires a lot of knowledge, covered with a lot of practice.\nThere are 4 main skill groups that all programmers must have. Most of these skills are resistant in time and are not significantly affected by the development in specific technologies (which are constantly changing). These are the skills that any good programmer has and to which every beginner must strive:\n\ncoding (20%)\nalgorithmic thinking (30%)\ncomputer science and software engineering concepts (25%)\nlanguages and software technologies (25%)\n\nSkill #1 – Coding (20%)\nWriting code forms around 20% of the minimum knowledge and skills of a programmer, needed for starting a job in a software company. The skill of coding includes the following components:\n\nWorking with variables, conditional statements, loops\nUsing functions, methods, classes, and objects\nData manipulation: arrays, lists, hash tables, strings\n\nThe skill of coding can be acquired in a few months of hard learning and solving practical problems by writing code every day. This book covers only the first point of coding: working with variables, conditional statements, and loops. The rest remains to be learned in follow-up trainings, courses, and books.\nThe book (and the courses based on it) gives only the beginning of one long and serious training on the way to professional programming. If you don't learn perfectly the material from this book, you can't become a programmer. You are going to miss fundamentals, and it will be harder in the future. For this reason, give enough time to programming basics: solve many tasks and write code every day for months until you learn to solve every task from the book very easily. Then go ahead.\nWe pay special attention to the fact that programming language doesn't have significant relevance for one's coding skill. You can either code or not. If you can code in C#, then you'll easily switch to Java, or C++, or any other language. That's why coding skills are heavily studied in the foundational software engineering courses at SoftUni. These are the skills that each programming book for beginners starts with, including this one.\nSkill #2 – Algorithmic thinking (30%)\nThe algorithmic (logical, engineering, mathematical, abstract) thinking forms around 30% of the minimum skills of a programmer needed to start the profession. Algorithmic thinking is the ability to break a particular task into a logical sequence of steps (algorithm) to find a solution for every separate step and then combine the steps into a working solution. That is the most important skill of any programmer.\nHow to build algorithmic thinking?\n\nAlgorithmic thinking is developed by solving multiple programming (1000+) tasks, as diverse as possible. That is the recipe: solving thousands of practical tasks, building algorithms, and implementing the algorithms, along with debugging the issues that come up in the process. \nSciences like physics, mathematics and identical ones help a lot, but they are not mandatory! People with engineering and technical skills usually learn very easily to think logically because they already have problem-solving skills, even if it is not algorithmic.\nThe ability to solving programming problems (for which algorithmic thinking is needed) is extremely important for a programmer. Many companies test particularly this skill during their job interviews.\n\nThe current book develops the beginner level of algorithmic thinking, but it's not enough to make you a good programmer. To become good at this profession, you must add logical thinking and problem-solving skills, beyond the range of this book. For example, working with data structures (arrays, lists, matrices, hash-tables, binary trees) and basic algorithms (searching, sorting, searching in tree structures, recursion, etc.).\nAlgorithmic thinking skill can be seriously developed at the beginner courses for software engineers at SoftUni, as well as in specialized algorithmic courses like those covering data structures and algorithms.\nAs you can guess the programming language doesn't matter for the development of algorithmic thinking. To think logically is a universal skill, and it's not related only to programming. Because of the well-developed logical thinking, it's believed that programmers are smart people.\nSkill #3 – Computer science and software engineering concepts (25%)\nFundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering, and computer science comprise around 25% of the developer's minimum skills to start a job. Here are the more important of these skills and knowledge:\n\nbasic mathematical concepts related to programming: coordinate systems, vectors and matrices, discrete and non-discrete mathematical functions, state automata and state machines, combinatorics and statistics concepts, algorithm complexity, mathematical modeling, and others\nprogramming skills – code writing, working with data, using conditional statements and loops, working with arrays, lists and associative arrays, strings and text processing, working with streams and files, using programming interfaces (APIs), working with IDE, debugger, developer tools, etc.\ndata structures and algorithms – lists, trees, hash tables, graphs, search, sorting, recursion, binary search trees, etc.\nobject-oriented programming (OOP) – working with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, data encapsulation, exceptions management, design patterns\nfunctional programming (FP) – working with lambda functions, higher-order functions, functions that return a function as a result, closure, etc.\ndatabases – relational and non-relational databases, database modeling (tables and links between them), SQL query language, object-relational mapping (ORM), transactions and transaction management\nnetwork programming – network protocols, network communication, TCP/IP, concepts, tools, and technologies from computer networks\nclient-server interaction, peer to peer communication, back-end technologies, front-end technologies, MVC architectures\ntechnologies for server development (back-end) – Web server architecture, HTTP protocol, MVC architecture, REST architecture, web development frameworks, templating engines\nweb front-end technologies (client-side development) – HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, DOM, AJAX, communication with back-end, calling REST API, front-end frameworks, basic design and UX (user experience) concepts\nmobile technologies – mobile apps, Android and iOS development, mobile user interface (UI), calling server logic \nembedded systems – microcontrollers, digital and analog input and output control, sensor access, peripheral management\noperating systems – working with operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.), installation, configuration, and basic system administration, process management, memory, file system, users, multitasking, virtualization, and containers\nparallel and asynchronous programming – thread management, asynchronous tasks, promises, common resources, and access synchronization\nsoftware engineering – source control systems, development management, task planning, and management, software development methodologies, software requirements, and prototypes, software design, software architectures, software documentation\nsoftware testing – unit testing, test-driven development, QA engineering, error reporting and error tracking, automation testing, build processes, and continuous integration\n\nWe need to clarify once again that the programming language does not matter for the assimilation of all these skills. They accumulate slowly, over many years of practice in the profession. Some knowledge is fundamental and can be learned theoretically, but for their full understanding and in-depth awareness, you need years of practice.\nFundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering, and computer science are taught during the Software Engineering Program, as well as several elective courses. Working with a variety of software libraries, APIs, frameworks, and software technologies and their interaction gradually builds this knowledge and skills, so do not expect that you will understand them from a single course, book or project.\nTo start working as a programmer, only basic knowledge in the areas listed above is enough, and improvement happens at the workplace according to the technology and development tools used in the company and the team.\nSkill #4 – Programming languages and software technologies (25%)\nProgramming languages and software development technologies form around 25% of a programmer's skills. They have the largest learning content, but they change very fast over time. If we look at the job offers in the software industry, they usually mention words like the ones below, but in the job offers, they secretly mention the three main skills: coding, algorithmic thinking, and knowing the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering.\nFor those technological skills the programming language does matter.\n\nNote: only for this 25% of the profession the programming language does matter!\nFor the rest 75% of the skills, the programming language doesn't matter, and these skills are resistant in time and transportable between different languages and technologies.\n\nHere are some commonly used software development stacks which software companies are looking for (as of Jan 2019):\n\nJava + Java API classes + OOP + FP + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + JSP / Servlets + Spring MVC or Java EE / JSF + cloud + containers\nC# + OOP + FP + classes from .NET + SQL Server databases + Entity Framework (EF) + ASP.NET MVC + HTTP + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + cloud + containers\nJavaScript (JS) + OOP + FP + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Node.js + Express + Angular or React + cloud + containers\nPython + OOP + FP + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web development + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Django or Flask + cloud + containers\nPHP + OOP + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web development + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Laravel or Symfony or other MVC framework for PHP + cloud + containers\nC++ + OOP + STL + Boost + native development + databases + HTTP + other languages and technologies\nSwift + OOP + MacOS + iOS + Cocoa + Cocoa Touch + XCode + HTTP + REST + other languages and technologies\nGo + OOP + Linux + Protobuf + gRPC + cloud + containers + other languages and technologies\n\nIf the words above look scary and incomprehensible, then you are at the very beginning of your career, and you need many years of learning until you reach the profession of a software engineer. Do not worry, every programmer goes through one or several technology stacks and needs to study a set of interconnected technologies, but the bottom line is the ability to write programming logic (coding), and the skill of algorithmic thinking (to solve programming problems). It's impossible without them!\nThe programming language doesn't matter!\nAs it already became clear, the difference between programming languages and more specifically between the skills of programmers in different languages and technologies forms around 10-20% of the skills.\n\nAll programmers have around 80-90% of the same skills that does not depend on the programming language! These are the skills to program and to design and develop software, that are very similar in different programming languages and development technologies.\nThe more languages and technologies you know, the faster you can learn new ones, and the less you will feel the difference between them.\n\nIndeed, the programming language almost does not matter. You have to learn to program, and this starts with coding (this book) goes on in the more complex programming concepts (like data structures, algorithms, OOP, and FP) and includes the use of fundamental knowledge and skills for software development, software engineering, and computer science.\nOnly finally, when you start working with a specific technology in a software project, you will need a specific programming language, knowledge about specific programming libraries (APIs), frameworks and software technologies (front-end UI technologies, back-end technologies, ORM technologies, etc.). Don't worry, you will learn them, all programmers are learning them, but first, you need to learn the foundation: to program and do it well.\nThis book uses the Java language, but it is not required and can be replaced with JavaScript, Python, PHP, C++, Ruby, Swift, Go, Kotlin, or any other language. To be a software developer, you need to learn coding (20%), learn algorithmic thinking, and solve problems (30%), to have fundamental knowledge of programming and computer science (25%) and to master a specific programming language and the technologies around it (25%). Be patient, ia a year or two, all this can be mastered at a good starting level if you are serious.\n\nThe story of this book\nThe main driver and project manager for the creation of this free open-source programming book are Dr. Svetlin Nakov. He is the main ideologist and author of the learning content of the training course \"Programming Basics\" in SoftUni, which was used as the basis of the book. \nEverything started with the mass free programming basics courses that have been conducted in the whole country since 2014 when the SoftUni initiative was launched. In the beginning, these courses had a larger range and covered more theory. In 2016 Dr. Svetlin Nakov completely reworked, updated, and simplified the whole method of teaching, strongly emphasizing practice. This is how the core of the learning content of this book was created.\nThe free courses at SoftUni for introduction to programming are probably the most massive trainings ever conducted in South-Eastern Europe. Until 2017 the course in programming basics was held over 150 times, in around 40 Bulgarian towns and cities in person and multiple times online with over 50 000 participants. It was completely natural to write a book for the tens of thousands of participants at the SoftUni basic programming course.\nFollowing the principle of free software and free knowledge, Svetlin Nakov led a team of volunteers and started this open-source project. At first, the idea was to create a free book for the basics of programming in the C# programming language and later extend the initiative with other similar books in various popular programming languages (like Java, JavaScript and Python).\nThis book is almost a mirror translation to Java from its original version in C#.\nThe project is part of the hard work of the Software University Foundation to create and distribute open learning content to teach software engineers and IT professionals.\nAuthors team\nThis book is developed by a broad author's team of volunteers who dedicated their time to give away the systematized knowledge and guide you at the start of programming. Below is a list of all authors and editors (in alphabetical order.)\n\nAsya Dikova-Kirova, Vaydin Kachanov, Ventsislav Petrov, Daniel Tsvetkov, Dimitar Dalev, Zhulieta Atanasova, Ivaylo Ivanov, Kristiyan Pamidov, Milena Georgieva, Nikolay Bankin, Petar Ivanov, Rositsa Nenova, Svetlin Nakov, Teodor Kurtev, Tsvetan Georgiev\n\nThe book is based on its initial C# variant (Introduction to Programming with C#) which is developed by a large team of authors that has a significant contribution to the current book:\n\nAleksandar Krastev, Aleksandar Lazarov, Angel Dimitriev, Vasko Viktorov, Ventsislav Petrov, Daniel Tsvetkov, Dimitar Tatarski, Dimo Dimov, Diyan Tonchev, Elena Rogleva, Zhivko Nedyalkov, Zhulieta Atanasova, Zahariya Pehlivanova, Ivelin Kirilov, Iskra Nikolova, Kalin Primov, Kristiyan Pamidov, Lyuboslav Lyubenov, Nikolay Bankin, Nikolay Dimov, Pavlin Petkov, Petar Ivanov, Rositsa Nenova, Ruslan Filipov, Svetlin Nakov, Stefka Vasileva, Teodor Kurtev, Tonyo Zhelev, Hristiyan Hristov, Hristo Hristov, Tsvetan Iliev, Yulian Linev, Yanitsa Valeva\n\nBook cover design: Marina Shiderova.\nOfficial book web site\nThe book Programming Basics with C# is available for free at the following web address:\nhttps://java-book.softuni.org\n\nThis is the official book site and any new version will be uploaded there.

You won't learn to program from just reading the book, so solve as many tasks as you can find!\n"},"chapter-01-first-steps-in-programming.html":{"url":"chapter-01-first-steps-in-programming.html","title":"1. First Steps in Programming","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1. First steps in programming\nIn this chapter, we are going to figure out what programming is at its core. We will get familiar with the idea of programming languages, and we will look at the integrated development environments (IDE) and how to work with them, particularly with IntelliJ IDEA. We will write and execute our first program with the programming language Java, and afterward, we will exercise with a few tasks we will create a console program, a graphic application and a web application. We are going to learn how to check for correctness the solutions from this book in the Judge system of SoftUni, and at the end, we will get familiar with the typical errors, which are made  when writing code and how to avoid them.\nVideo\n\n  Watch a video lesson on this chapter here: \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU_JUiersZg.\n\n\nWhat does it mean to program\nTo program means to give instructions to the computer, for example, play a certain sound, print something on the screen or multiply two numbers. When there is a series of commands, we have a computer program (script). The computer program's text is called program code (source code or just code).\nComputer programs\nComputer programs represent series of commands written in a particular programming language, like Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Go, etc. To write commands, we need to be familiar with the syntax and semantics of the language we'll be using, in our case – Java. In this book we will cover programming in general, as well as Python's particular syntax and semantics. We will examine each step of writing code, starting with the simplest and eventually reaching more complex programming constructs.\nAlgorithms\nComputer programs usually execute some sort of algorithm. Algorithms are series of steps used to complete a task and achieve an expected result - something like a recipe. For example, if we need to fry some eggs, we follow a specific recipe (algorithm): we heat some oil in a pan, then we break the eggs, we wait until they are cooked, and finally, move the pan away from the heat. Similarly, in programming, computer programs execute algorithms – series of commands needed to complete a specific task, for example, if we want to print a series of numbers in ascending order, we need an algorithm. It will go through all the numbers, find the smallest one and print it, then go through the rest of them and do the same until there are no more numbers left.\nTo make creating programs, writing program code (commands), executing it, and other operations that have to do with programming more convenient, we need a development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ.\nProgramming languages, compilers, interpreters, and environments for development\nProgramming languages are artificial languages (syntax for expression), designed to issue commands which we expect the computer to read, process, and execute. With the help of programming languages, we write series of commands (programs) which tell the computer what to do. Execution of computer programs can be achieved by using either a compiler or an interpreter.\nThe compiler translates code from a programming language into machine code and for each construct (command) in the code, it chooses an appropriate, predefined fragment of machine code while simultaneously checking the program's text for errors. Together, all the compiled fragments represent the original program translated in machine code, exactly how the computer's microprocessor is expecting it. After it's been compiled, the program can be directly executed by the microprocessor in cooperation with the operating system. Compiled programming languages compile the program before executing it and find syntactic errors (incorrect commands) during compile time. Languages like C++, C#, Java, Swift, and Go work with compilers.\nSome programming languages don't use a compiler but are directly interpreted by specialized software called an interpreter. The interpreter is a program that executes programs, written in some programming language. It executes the program's commands in sequence and understands not only single commands and series of commands but also other language constructs (checks, iterations, functions, etc.). PHP, Python, and JavaScript are languages that work with an interpreter and are executed without the need to be compiled. Due to lack of preliminary compilation, interpreted languages' errors are found during run time after the program has already started working.\nThe development environment (Integrated Development Environment – IDE) combines traditional instruments for software development. In the development environment we write code, compile and execute programs. Development environments incorporate a text editor for writing code, a programming language, a compiler or interpreter, an execution environment where our program is executed, a debugger which traces our program and looks for errors, instruments for design and user interface as well as other instruments and add-ons.\nDevelopment environments are convenient because they incorporate everything necessary to develop a program, so there's no need to leave the environment. If we don't use a development environment, we'll have to write code in a text editor, compile it with a command from the console, execute it with another command from the console and write additional commands, when needed, which will cost a lot of time. This is why most programmers use IDEs for everyday work.\nFor programming with the Java language the most commonly used development environment is IntelliJ IDEA, which is developed and distributed by JetBrains and it can be downloaded free from their website: https://jetbrains.com/idea.\nAlternatives of IntelliJ IDEA are Eclipse https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages, NetBeans https://netbeans.apache.org/download and JDeveloper https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/jdeveloper-12c-downloads.html and many others. In the current book, we are going to use IntelliJ IDEA.\nIf you don't have an opportunity to install an IDE, you can use some online Java IDE like Repl.it https://repl.it/languages/java.\nLow- and high-level languages, runtime environments\nA program is, in essence, a set of instructions that ask the computer to carry out specific tasks. They are entered by the programmer and executed unconditionally by the machine.\nThere are different types of programming languages. Lowest-level languages are used to write the instructions commanding the processor - Assembler is one such language. Higher-level languages are utilized to create an operating system, drivers for managing hardware (video card drivers, for example), web browsers, compilers, engines for game graphics (game engines), and other system components and programs. Even higher-level languages like JavaScript, C#, and Python are used to create application software, like programs for reading mail or chatting.\nLow-level languages command hardware directly and require a lot of effort, and a vast number of commands, to carry out a specific task. Higher-level languages require less code to achieve the same result but have no direct access to hardware. They are used to develop application software like web and mobile applications.\nMost of the software we use daily like music players, video players, GSP programs, etc., is written on high-level languages for application programming like Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, C++, PHP, etc.\nJava is a compiled language, and this means that we are writing commands, which are being compiled before they are executed. The code, written in Java, is not compiled to machine code for a specific processor, but for a specific language, called Java bytecode. Due to that, the execution of a program, written in Java, requires a virtual machine - Java Virtual Machine (JVM). \nThe Java compiler, the virtual machine, and many libraries stand inside the core of the Java platform. The Java platform is developed in a few variations\n\nJava Standard Edition (Java SE) – the basic version, which is used for the development of client applications and the so-called Java applets.\nJava Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – based on the Standard Edition, it is mostly used with server applications on the internet, but besides that, it includes many other software technologies.\nJava Micro Edition (Java ME) – a standalone light version for working on devices with limited computing power like mobile phones, smartphones, PDA devices, and others.\n\nComputer programs - compilation and execution\nAs we have already mentioned, the program is a sequence of commands, in other words, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations, and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to accomplish some result.\nThe program is written in text format, and the text of the program itself is called a source code. It is compiled to an executable file (for example, Program.cs is compiled to Program.exe), or it is executed directly from the .NET environment.\nThe compilation process of the code, before its execution, is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java, and C++. Scripts and interpreted languages, like JavaScript, Python, and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.\nComputer programs – examples\nLet us start with a simple example Java program, which consists of a single command.\nExample – a command which prints a given text\nOur first program will consist of a single Java command which prints the word \"Hello\"\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");\n\nIn a moment, we will get to know how to execute this command, but for now, we will just stick to what commands in programming consist of. Let us have a look at a few more examples.\nExample: A program which checks whether a word contains another word\nWe can check whether the word \"alright\" consist of the word \"right\" using the contains method:\nSystem.out.println(\"alright\".contains(\"right\"));\n\nExample: A program which converts Bulgarian levs into euro\nLet us have a look at another simple program which reads a number of levs (whole number) from the user, converts them into euro (divides them by the euro exchange rate) and prints the result. This is a program of three consecutive commands.\nScanner console = new Scanner(System.in);\ndouble leva = Double.parseDouble(console.nextLine());\ndouble euro = leva / 1.95583;\nSystem.out.println(euro);\n\nWe looked at three examples of computer programs: two with a single command, and one consisting of a sequence of three commands. Let us now move on to the more exciting bit: writing, compiling and executing our programs in Java.\nHow do we write a console program?\nLet's go through the necessary steps to create and execute a computer program which uses a text console (window for entering and printing text) to read and write its data. Such programs are called console programs. But first of all, we need to install and prepare the development environment where we will write and execute the Java programs from this book and the exercises that go along with it.\nJava development kit (JDK)\nTo create programs using the Java programming language, we need to install the Java Development Kit. It includes a virtual machine, a Java compiler and numerous helper tools. JDK should not be confused for a runtime environment – Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Installing JRE will allow us to open and work with Java programs but won't give us the ability to develop our own.\nInstalling JDK\nJDK is distributed freely and can be downloaded from this link: https://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads.  Choose the latest version of Java SE (Java Standard Edition).\n\nWe need to accept the license agreement and choose the installation file which corresponds to our operating system. Windows 64-bit, for instance.\n\nThen we can download the installation file and run it. The installer which opens should look like this on a Windows environment:\n\nPress the [Next] button a few times until the Java development Kit starts installing:\n\nWhen it's finished, close the installer with the [Close] button.\nInstallation on a Linux environment may be completely different, but most often, you need to install a standard package from the central repository sudo apt install default-jdk.\nDevelopment environment (IDE)\nAs was already noted, we need a development environment (IDE – Integrated Development Environment) to program. The IDE is a program editor, where we write program code and execute it, discover our mistakes, correct them and start the program again.\n\nSuitable for Java programming are the IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans environments.\n\nInstalling IntelliJ IDEA\nLet us start installing the integrated environment IntelliJ IDEA Community (version 2021, current as of September 2021).\nThe community version of IntelliJ IDEA is free distributed by JetBrains and can be downloaded from this link: https://jetbrains.com/idea/download.\nThe following paragraphs contain a detailed description of the steps needed to install IntelliJ IDEA (version Community 2021). After we download and run the installation file, appear the following screen:\n\nWe click the [Next] button, and we will see the following window displayed:\n\nWe click the [Next] button one more time, and IntelliJ IDEA's installation panel gets loaded on the screen.\n\nDepending on our operating system, we choose the 32 or the 64-bit launcher.  Then we tick the [.java], [.groovy] and [.kt] boxes and click [Next].\nWe save the folder's name in the start menu and click [Install]. The following screen should appear once IntelliJ IDEA has started installing:\n\nWhen the process is finished, tick the [Run IntelliJ IDEA] box and hit [Finish], which will wrap up the installation and run the development environment.\n\nWe choose [Create New Project] from IntelliJ IDEA's welcome screen:\n\nA window that shows we haven't chosen a software development kit (SDK) gets displayed:\n\nWe click [New] and find the route to the Java Development Kit (JDK) we already installed, being careful not to choose JRE.\n\nThen we select the JDK installation folder and click [OK]. That is it. We are ready to start working with IntelliJ IDEA.\nOlder versions of IntelliJ IDEA\nUsing older versions of IntelliJ IDEA is possible but not advisable. Older versions might not contain some of the newest development options, and some of the examples from this book may not be compile.\nOnline development environments\nThere are also online development environments which allow you to write code directly in your browser. They are not the most convenient, but if you have no other options, you can use them at the start of your education and install IntelliJ IDEA later. You can find useful links here:\n\nFor Java, we can use the following online Java IDE: https://www.compilejava.net.\nFor C# we can use .NET Fiddle: https://dotnetfiddle.net.\nFor JavaScript, we can write JS code directly in our browser by pressing [F12].\n\nProject solutions and Projects in IntelliJ IDEA\nThe IntelliJ IDEA project uses logic to group the numerous files that make up a specific application or component. A single IntelliJ IDEA project consists of several Java source files, configuration files, and other resources. Each Java source file can have several definitions and types (classes or other definitions). Classes contain methods (actions), which consist of series of commands. It may seem complicated, but in larger projects, this structure is extremely convenient and allows for a good organization of our work files.\nExample: creating a 'Hello Java' console program\nLet us get back to our console program. Now that we have IntelliJ IDEA installed, we can run it. Then we will create a new project: [Create New Project]. Choose [Java] -> [Command Line App] from the dialog window and give our project an appropriate name – HelloJava, for instance.\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA will create a blank Java program for us and we will need to write the code for it.\nWriting program code\nJava programs' source code is written between the curly brackets of the main(String[] args) section. It is the main method (action) executed when starting a Java program. Press [Enter] after the opening bracket, and we can start writing. In regards to text formatting, program code is written with an indentation which helps when reviewing and debugging it. \n\nWe can write the following command:\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello Java\");\n\nAnd here's what our program in IntelliJ IDEA should look like:\n\nThe System.out.printIn(\"Hello Java\") command in the Java language allows us to print the text message \"Hello Java\" on the console ('out.printIn(…)'). The message needs to be enclosed in quotes that signify text. At the end of every Java command we place a semicolon ; that indicates the end of a command (meaning it doesn't continue on the next row).\nThis command is quite typical for programming: signify we need a certain object (a PrintStream object named out located in the object System, in this case) to be found, and a certain action (printing something, passed within brackets, in this case) to be performed on it. In more technical terms, we call the method printIn(…) from the class PrintStream, part of the System class, and pass as a parameter to it the text Hello Java.\nClasses and files in Java\nJava is an object-oriented language hence why every Java program consists of at least one class. If the Java class is public, its name needs to match the name of the file + .java. In the above example, the Main class, defined with public class Main {…}, is located in a file named Main.java in the project's src folder. Were it called HelloJava, its source code would need to be located in a file named HelloJava.java. Otherwise, we'd get a compile-time error. \nStarting the program\nWe start the program by pressing [Ctrl + Shift + F10]. If there are no errors, the program will execute. The result will be displayed on the console (the window at the very bottom of IntelliJ IDEA).\n\nThe result of the program is the following message:\nHello Java\n\nThe additional Process finished with exit code 0 message is written last in the console and signifies that the program has ended with no errors.\nTesting the program in the Judge system\nTesting the solutions to the problems in this book is completely automated via the Judge System's website: https://judge.softuni.org. The solutions are judged in real-time by the system. Each solution goes through a series of of hidden tests, and every test that passes grants the user certain points.\nThe program that we just wrote can be tested here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/646#0.\nWe need to paste the program's entire source code in the black field and make sure we've selected Java code from the dropdown menu.\n\nThen we can send our solution by clicking the [Submit] button. The system returns a result in a few seconds, which is displayed in the table of submitted solutions. If necessary, we can hit the [Refresh] button at the upper right-hand corner of the table of submitted solutions:\n\nThe Judge System will display one of the following possible results in the table:\n\nNumber of points (between 0 and 100), when the submitted code is compiled successfully (there are no syntactic errors) and can be tested.\nIf our solution is correct, all tests are marked in green, and we receive 100 points.\nIf our solution is incorrect, some tests are marked in red, and we receive less than 100 or 0 points.\n\n\nIf there are syntactic errors in our program, we receive a compile time error message.\n\nHow do I register at SoftUni Judge?\nJust use your id (Username + Password) for the softuni.bg website. If you haven't yet registered, go right ahead – it's just a standard website registration and takes no more than a minute.\nTypical mistakes in Java programs\nOne mistake that often sees with beginners is that they write their code outside the body of the main(String[] args) method. It causes an error because the integrated environment or the compiler cannot read the commands issued in the program correctly. Here is an example of an incorrect program:\nstatic void main(String[] args)\n{\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello SoftUni\");\n\nAnother usual mistake is mixing up capital and lowercase letters. They matter when we call commands and can impede proper functioning. Here is an example of such a mistake:\nstatic void main(String[] args)\n{\n    System.out.Println(\"Hello SoftUni\");\n}\n\nIn the example above, PrintIn is written incorrectly, and the capital letter P needs to be changed to lowercase.\nThe missing semicolon (;) at the end of commands is one of the timeless issues for beginner programmers. Skipping this symbol leads to the program functioning improperly, and it is very often left unnoticed**. Here is an example of incorrect code:\nstatic void main(String[] args)\n{\n    System.out.println(\"Hello SoftUni\")\n}\n\nA missing quotation mark or closing bracket can also cause issues. As with the semicolon, this will lead to the program either function improperly or not executing at all. Such mistakes are hard to notice, especially with large amounts of code. Here is an example of an incorrect program with a lonely opening quotation mark:\nstatic void main(String[] args)\n{\n    System.out.println(\"Hello SoftUni);\n}\n\nThis program will return a compile-time error, and even before that, the code will be underlined to draw the programmer's attention towards the error (missing closing quotation mark).\nAnother beginner's frequent mistake is trying to write the main(…) method outside the class:\npublic class Example {\n}\n\nstatic void main(String[] args)\n{\n    System.out.println(\"Method outside of the class\");\n}\n\nThe correct way to do this is by placing the main(…) method within the Example class and saving the entire code in the Example.java file:\n Put this code in the file Example.java\n\npublic class Example {\n    static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(Correct class);\n    }\n}\n\nWhat did we learn in this chapter?\nFirst of all, we learned what programming is – issuing commands written in a computer language which the machine can understand and carry out. We also found out what a computer program is – a series of commands that aim to achieve a certain result. We gained some basic knowledge of the Java programming language and learned how to create simple console programs using IntelliJ IDEA. We followed Java's program code structure, one example of which is that issuing of commands mainly happens in the static void main(String[] args) section, within the curly brackets. We looked at printing with the function System.out.printIn(…) and starting the program with [Ctrl + Shift + F10]. And last but not least, we now know how to test our code in SoftUni's Judge System.\nTop work! Let us now tackle the exercises. You remember that learning how to program involves a lot of code writing and problem-solving, right? Let us do just that and put what we have learned into practice.\nFirst steps in programming – Exercises\nWelcome to the exercises. We are now going to write a couple of console applications, which will help us make a few more steps into programming. After that we will show you how to program something more complex – programs with graphical and web user interface.\nExercise: console-based program 'Expression'\nWrite a console-based Java program that calculates and prints the value of the following numerical expression:\n (3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3 \n\nNote: you are not allowed to previously calculate the value (for example, with Windows Calculator).\nHints and guidelines\nCreate a new Java file and name it Expression. Then we find the method static void main(String[] args) and start writing in its body (the space between the opening and closing curly braces). We need to write the code, which will calculate the numeric expression above and print its value on the console. Pass the expression to the System.out.printIn(…) command by writing it within its brackets:\n\nStart the program with [Ctrl + Shift + F10] and check whether the result matches the one from the picture:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/646#1.\n\nExercise: Numbers from 1 to 20\nWrite a Java console program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 on separate lines on the console.\nHints and guidelines\nCreate a new Java class and name it Nums1to20 (right click on the src folder -> [New] -> [Java Class])\n\nInside the static void main(String[] args method, write 20 print() commands, each on a separate line, to print the numbers from 1 to 20 one after another. Some of you may be wondering if there is a cleverer way. Don't worry, there is, but we will mention it later on.\n\nLet's now start the program and check whether the result is what we're expecting:\n1\n2\n…\n20\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/646#2.\nNow try and think of a cleverer way we can write this program, to avoid repeating the same command so many times. Look up information for \"for loop Java\" on the Internet.\nExercise: Triangle of 55 stars\nWrite a Java console program that prints a triangle of 55 stars on 10 lines:\n*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n******\n*******\n********\n*********\n**********\nHints and guidelines\nCreate a new Java console application and name it TriangleOf55Stars. Inside we need to write code that prints the triangle of stars, using commands like the ones below:\nSystem.out.println();\nSystem.out.println();\n…\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/646#3.\nTry and improve your solution to avoid repeating the same command so many times. Can this be achieved with a for-loop? Did you manage to invent a better solution (with a for-loop, for example) to the previous problem? The current problem can be solved with a similar but more complex approach (a loop within another loop). It is completely fine if you can't figure it out, you will remember this problem when we learn about loops in a few chapters.\nExercise: Rectangle Area\nWrite a Java program that receives two numbers, a and b, then calculates and prints the area of a rectangle with sides a and b.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\na\nb\narea\n\n\n\n\n2\n7\n14\n\n\n7\n8\n56\n\n\n12\n5\n60\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nCreate a new Java console application. We will use the following code to read our numbers:\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class RectangleArea {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int a = Integer.parseInt(console.nextLine());\n        int b = Integer.parseInt(console.nextLine());\n\n        // TODO: calculate the area and print it\n    }\n}\n\nTo read input data from the console, we import and use the java.util.Scanner class, which we will look at in detail a little later. For now, just accept that the reading number is achieved as in the example above.\nWhat is left is to finish the program to calculate the rectangle's area and print it. Pass the product of  a and b to the already familiar System.out.printIn() command. In programming, we multiply using the * operator.\nTest your solution\nTest your solution with a few examples. You should receive a result identical to the one you see below (we enter 2 and 7 as input, and the program prints 14 – their product, as output):\n2\n7\n14\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#4.\n* Exercise: Square of Stars\nWrite a Java console program which reads a whole positive number N from the console and prints a square of N stars on the console, like in the examples below.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n**** ****\n4\n*****  **  *****\n5\n******   **   **   ******\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nCreate a new Java console program. To read the number N (2 ≤ N ≤100), we use the following code:\nScanner console = new Scanner(System.in);\nint n = Integer.parseInt(console.nextLine());\n\n// TODO: print the rectangle\n\nDon't forget to import the java.util.Scanner class and put your code in the main(…) method of your program's main class .Finish the program so that it prints a square made up of stars. You may need to use for-loops. Look up information on the Internet.\nCaution: this task is more complex than the rest and is presented to you at this point purposefully. It is marked with a star to provoke you to look for information on the Internet. It is one of the most important skills you have to develop while you're learning to program. It is what you'll be doing every day if you work as a developer, so don't be scared to try it out. \nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/646#5.\nConsole, graphical and web applications\nWith console applications, as you can figure out yourselves, all operations for reading input and printing output are done through the console. There the input data is inserted, which is read from the application also in it, is printed the output data after or during the runtime of the program.\nWhile the console application uses the text console, web applications use web-based user interface. To receive their performance are needed two things - a web server and a web browser, as the browser plays the main role in the visualization of the data and the interaction with the user. Web applications are much more pleasant for the user, they visually look better, and a mouse and touch screen can be used (for tablets and smartphones), but behind all of that stands programming. And this is why we have to learn to program. We have already made our first steps.\nGraphical (GUI) applications have a visual user interface, directly into your computer or mobile device, without a web browser. Graphical applications (or otherwise said, desktop applications) contain one or more graphical windows, which consist of specific controllers (text fields, buttons, pictures, tables, and others), serving for dialog with the user more intuitively. Similar to them are the mobile applications in your telephone or your tablet, we use forms, text fields, buttons, and other controls, and we control them by programming code. It is why we are learning how to write code now the code is everywhere in software development.\nExercises graphical and web applications\nNow we are about to build one simple web application and one simple graphical application, in order to take a look at what we will be able to create when we progress with programming and software development. We are not going to look through the details about the used techniques and constructions fundamentally, rather we are just going to take a look at the arrangement and functionality of our creation. After we progress with our knowledge, we will be able to do bigger and more complex software applications and systems. We hope that the examples given below will enlighten your interest, rather than make you give up.\nProblem graphical application \"Summator for numbers\"\nWrite a graphical (GUI) application, which calculates the sum of two numbers:\n\nBy entering two numbers in the first two fields and pressing the button [Calculate], their sum is being calculated, and the result is shown in the third text field.\nUnlike console applications, which read and write their data as text on the console graphical (GUI) applications have a visual user interface. Graphical applications (desktop applications) consist of one or more graphic windows, in which there are controls text fields, buttons, pictures, tables, and others.\nFor our application, we will use the technology JavaFX. It allows us to create graphical applications for every platform using Java language. For the environment for development, we are going to use the program IntelliJ IDEA.\nTo create graphical applications with JavaFX, we will use the program that we can download from httpsgluonhq.comproductsscene-builder#download.\n\nWe install SceneBuilder for the design of the JavaFX user interface.\n\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, create a new Java project of type JavaFX Application\n\nWhen creating a JavaFX application, a project with a few files will be generated.\n\nThe file, inside which is the view of our application, can be found on the path [src/sample/sample.fxml]. Let us go there and open it\n\nThe file looks like this. We will not work with it directly later, but we will use the mentioned above SceneBuilder, which will generate code instead of us. We click the right mouse button on the file and choose [Open in SceneBuilder].\n\nBy choosing the option for the first time, IntelliJ IDEA will ask us to enter the path towards SceneBuilder.exe:\n\nWith the usual Windows installation of SceneBuilder, it is found in [C:\\Users[username]\\AppData\\Local\\SceneBuilder]. \nAfter we have pointed the right path, SceneBuilder opens, and we see the following screen:\n\nWe have the types of controls we can add on the left-hand side of the screen, so let us find the [AnchorPane] window and add it by dragging it to the environment where our design is located.\n\nIt is our window where we can now start adding controls located in the same place we added [AnchorPane] from (in the [Containers] menu). For our interface we will need:\n\n3 text fields: TextField\n2 labels between the text fields (for + and =) \n1 button for calculation the result: Button\n\nAfter we have added them, our application should look like this:\n\nWe will rename the controls by choosing more appropriate names, reflecting our application's functionality (\"+\" and \"=\"). It is achieved by clicking the control we wish to change and go to its [Properties] on the right.\nFirst, we will change the Text property of the tickets. Their name is Label by default:\n\nWe will choose more meaningful names which will reflect our program's logic better. Change the first text Label with +:\n\nThen do the same with the second ticket and the button - change the former's text to = and the latter's to Calculate \n\nWe will save our design changes using [Ctrl+S]:\n\nNow go back to IntelliJ IDEA and start the application using [Shift+F10]:\n\nThe application's size is most likely not what you expected it to be. It is due to a piece of our code explicitly stating what that size needs to be. Let us resolve the issue:\nGo to the Main class and find the piece of code\n\nDelete the code responsible for window size, so our program can use the sizing we chose in SceneBuilder.\n\nNow the code looks like this:\n\nWe start the program once more using [Shift+F10] and check whether the sizing is correct.\n\nThe final step in our design is to go back to our code and change the application's title, located on this line:\n\nChange the name from \"Hello World\" to \"Sumator\":\n\nAnd start the application:\n\nThe graphical part's design looks ready. It is now time for something a lot more interesting – the program logic. Time to write the code which sums the numbers from the first two fields and displays the result in the third field. To do that, we need to go back to SceneBuilder and give the text fields names so we can access them in the code:\n\nClick the first text field and go to the [Code] section on the right, where we will enter the name num1 in the fxid field:\n\nThen rename the second field to num2:\n\nAnd the third field to result:\n\nNow we will tell the button what function to perform once it is clicked. Go to the On Action field and enter the name of the function calculate, which we will create in a moment:\n\nSave the changes in SceneBuilder using [Ctrl+S] and go back to the sample.fxml file\n\nWe can see that our fields have names, and our button has a function to perform once it is clicked.\nSo far, so good, but these fields and the button's function don't yet exist in our code. To generate them, we will go to each one of them and press [Alt+Enter] -> [Create field] (the field's name]\n\nOnce we create one of the fields, we will get redirected to the Controller.java file, where the field will be generated in the code in the following manner:\n\nWrite the following Java code between the curly braces of the calculate function:\n\nThis code takes the first number from the field num1 and stores it in the variable num1, then does the same with the num2 field and stores it in the variable num2. The numbers are then summed, storing their value in the variable result, and finally, the latter's text value is visualized in the result field.\n\nStart the program again with [Shift+F10] and check if it is working. Check whether we can calculate the sum of different values correctly. First, we enter two whole numbers – 4 and 5, for example:\n\nThen we try summing negative and positive floating-point numbers – for example, -12.5 and 1.3:\n\nHow about entering invalid input such as aaa and bbb**:\n\nWe have a problem when the user enters invalid input data:\n\nIt is due to the transformation of our text field into a number. If the value in the field isn't a number, the program crashes, and returns an error (exception). We can fix the code by doing the following:\n\nWith this code, we intercept errors when working with numbers (catch exceptions), and in case of an error, we display the value \"error\" in our result field. Start the program again with [Shift+F10] and check if it's working. This time, if an incorrect number is entered, the result is \"error\" and the program doesn't crash:\n\nDoes all this seem complicated? If it does, that's completely normal. We are at the beginning of our programming journey. The example above requires much more knowledge and skills, which we will develop using this book and later on. Just allow yourself to have some fun with desktop programming. If something doesn't work, feel free to ask for help in the SoftUni discussion forum: https://forum.softuni.org, or bravely move forward to the next example or the next chapter in the book. A time will come when this will be easy for you, but you have to put in some effort and be persistent. Learning programming is a slow process involving lots and lots of practice.\nWeb application: 'Numbers summator'\nNow, we will create something even more complex but more interesting: a Web application that calculates the sum of two numbers. By entering two numbers in the first two text fields and clicking the [Calculate] button, their sum is calculated, and the result is displayed in the third text field. The application is expected to look like as is shown below:\n\nUnlike the console applications that read and write data as text on the console, Web applications have a Web-based user interface. Web applications are loaded from some Internet address (URL) through a standard web browser. Users write input data on a page, visualized by the web browser, the data is processed on a web server, and the results are shown again on a page in the web browser.\nFor our web application, we will use Spring MVC. It enables us to create a web application with the Java programming language in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment.\nTake the project (the application's skeleton) from this link:\nhttps://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-Java-BG/blob/master/assets/chapter-1-assets and load it in IntelliJ IDEA using [Import Project]:\n\nFind the folder where we have downloaded the skeleton:\n\nChoose [Import project from external model] and then [Maven]:\n\nIt is the screen that comes up next:\n\nProceed by clicking [Next]:\n\nAnd again continue with [Next]:\n\nOne more time – [Next]:\n\nOnce the project is loaded, in IntelliJ, it should look something like this:\n\nLet us start the project and make sure it runs without errors. To do that, we will go to the [src/main/javacom.softuni] folder and open the SumatorApplication file:\n\nTo run the program, we can either use the [Ctrl+Shift+F10] key combination, or select [Run 'SumatorApplication.main()'] from the context menu:\n\nOnce the web application is loaded, we should see the following message at the bottom of the console which has appeared:\n\nWe can run the application and check whether it's working by opening our web browser and typing localhost:8080 in the address bar:\n\nAll seems fine but when we enter the two numbers and hit [Calculate], nothing happens. Let us write the logic needed to summing both numbers to work as expected. Open the HomeController file in the same folder, and we should be able to see the following:\n\nThe part we are interested in is the sum function:\n\nCurrently, this function accepts two pieces of text num1 and num2, passes them to the server and returns the file index to the user. As you have probably realized, there is no code to calculate the numbers from the two text fields and enter the result in the third field. Let us write the logic to make it happen.\nGo between the curly braces and write the following code:\n\nHere is what the HomeController file should look like after the change:\n\nBefore we go back to the application, we need to apply our changes. We'll do that by going to the console window and clicking the [Rerun application] button.\n\nThe application is completed. If we enter the two numbers in the text fields and click the [Calculate] button, we should see the result come up in the third text field:\n\nDoes all this seem scary? There's no need to be afraid! We have a lot to learn to reach the knowledge and skills required to write web-based applications, with ease like in the example above, and much bigger and more complex applications. If it all makes little sense, just keep going without worrying. In time, you will remember with a smile how incomprehensible and exciting your first collision with web programming was. \nThe purpose of both examples (the graphical desktop application and web application) is not to teach you, but to allow you to dive a little deeper into programming, to fuel your interest towards software development and to inspire you to study hard. You have a lot to learn, but it is interesting, isn't it?\n"},"chapter-02-simple-calculations.html":{"url":"chapter-02-simple-calculations.html","title":"2.1. Simple Calculations","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2.1. Simple Calculations\nIn this chapter, we are going to get familiar with the following concepts and programming techniques:\n\nWhat is system console?\nHow to read numbers from the system console?\nHow to work with data types and variables, which are necessary to process numbers and the operations between them?\nHow to print (a number) on the console?\nHow to do simple arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, string concatenation?\n\nVideo\n\n  Watch a video lesson on this chapter here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u4X5X-a9Qg.\n\n\nThe system console\nThe system console or the computer console, usually called just a console,  represents the tool by which we give the computer commands in a text format and get the results from their execution again as a text.\nGenerally, the system console represents a text terminal which means that it accepts and visualizes just text without any graphical elements like buttons, menus, etc. Usually, it looks like a black-colored window, in which we write and perform console commands and print the result in the form of a text. In Windows, the console looks like this:\n\nIn most operating systems, generally, the console is available as a standalone application on which we write different console commands. In Windows, it is called Command Prompt, while in Linux and macOS, it is called Terminal. The console runs console applications. They read the text as input from the command line and print the output as a text on the console. In this book, we are going to learn programming mostly through creating console applications.\nThis is how the console looks in Linux:\n\nReading integers from the console\nIn Java we have several options to read an input from the console. The one way is via the built-in class Scanner, which we will use now, and the other is via BufferedReader. The second one is a bit faster, but we will start using it after we get familiar with the streams in Java.\nТо read an integer (not floating-point number) from the console we have to import the built-in class Scanner on the first line of our program even before the base class declaration. We put this line at the top:\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nThen in the main(…) method of the program, we have to create a new Scanner instance used to attach the system input. After that (via the created scanner reader) we can read integers, floating-point numbers, text, etc. For example, with .nextInt() we read the next integer given as input:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint num = scanner.nextInt();\n\nIn the example above, in the variable num of integer type int, we will have a value read as input from the console.\nJava is highly typed language this means that the variables have type determine at compile-time and can not change at the execution time (as it is in dynamic languages such as JavaScript and Python). In the example above scanner is from type java.util.Scanner (scanning text reader) and the variable num is from type int (integer number).\nExample: Calculating the area of the square with side а\nAs an example, let us look at a program. The task is to calculate the area of a square by a given side's length read as input from the console. The sample source code of the program is below. The code reads an integer as input from the console, multiply it by itself (squares it), and as output prints the result from the multiplication. Save the code in a file with the name SquareArea.java, or else you will have a compile-time error:\n// Put this code in the file: SquareArea.java\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SquareArea {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.print(\"a = \");\n        int a = scanner.nextInt();\n        int area = a * a;\n\n        System.out.print(\"Square area = \");\n        System.out.println(area);\n    }\n}\n\nHere is how the program would work when we have a square with a side's length equal to 15:\n\nTest the program with an invalid integer (as an input), for example, \"hello\". You will get an error message during runtime (exception). \n\nIt is normal because Java is a highly typed language. Later on, we will find out how we can catch these kinds of errors and make the user enter a new input (a number in the example above).\nHow Does the Example Work?\nThe first line Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); creates a new instance from the Scanner class with standard system input.\nThe following line System.out.print(\"a = \"); prints an informative message which invites the user to enter the side a of the square. After the output is printed the cursor stays on the same line. Staying on the same line is more convenient for the user visually. We use System.out.print(…); and not System.out.println(…); and this way the cursor stays on the same line.\nThe following line int a = scanner.nextInt(); reads an integer from the console. The result is kept in a variable with a name a.\nThe following line int area = a * a; keeps the result of the multiplication of a by a in a new variable with a name area.\nThe following line System.out.print(\"Square area = \"); prints the given text without going to the next line. Again, use System.out.print(…); and not System.out.println(\"…\"); and this way the cursor stays on the same line to print the calculated area of the square afterward.\nAt the last line System.out.println(area); prints the calculated value of the variable area.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#0.\nReading floating-point numbers from the console\nTry to rewrite the above program to accept as input data not only integers (int) but floating-point numbers (double). You can use scanner.nextDouble(). Later in this chapter, we will learn more about floating-point numbers.\nCalculations in programming\nWe know about computers that they are machines that process data. All data is stored in the computer memory (Random-access memory(RAM)) in variables. A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory that stores data from certain types, for example, numbers or text. Each variable in Java has name, type and value. In the example below, you can see how to define a variable, and at the same time to assign value to it:\n\nAfter processing, the data is stored again in variables (somewhere in a reserved area allocated in memory by our program).\nData types and variables\nIn programming, each variable stores a certain value of a particular type. For example, data types can be: number, letter, text (string), date, colour, image, list and others.\nHere are some examples of data types:\n\ntype int number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …\ntype double number: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …\ntype a letter from the alphabet (symbol): 'a', 'b', 'c', …\ntype text (string): \"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Beer\", …\ntype day of the week: Monday, Tuesday, …\n\nReading floating-point numbers from the console\nTo read floating-point number from the console, again it is neccessary to declare variable, to point out the type of the number, and to use the standard command to read information from the system console:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nDouble num = scanner.nextDouble();\n\nExample: Converting inches into centimeters\nWrite a program that reads a floating-point number (representing inches) as an input from the console, converts it to centimeters, and print the result as output:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Inches = \");              \nDouble inches = scanner.nextDouble();\nDouble centimeters = inches * 2.54;\nSystem.out.print(\"Centimeters = \");\nSystem.out.println(centimeters);\n\nRun the program and make sure that when entering a value in inches, we obtain a correct output in centimeters:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#1.\nReading and printing text\nTo read a text (string) from the console, again we declare new variable and use the standard command for reading a text from the console:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nString str = scanner.nextLine();\n\nLet's pay attention to the fact that reading text does not require converting to another type. It is this way because by default, the method scanner.nextLine(…) returns as result text. Additionally, we can parse the text to an integer by Integer.parseInt(…) or floating-point number by Double.parseDouble(…). If we do not parse to a number, each number will be just text for the program, and we can not do arithmetic operations with them.\nExample: Greeting by name\nWrite a program that reads the user's name as input from the console and greets him with the text Hello, name, where name is the name read as input data.\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nString name = scanner.nextLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"Hello, %s!\", name);\n\nIn this case the expression %s is replaced with the first passed argument, which is the variable name:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#2.\nConcatenating text and numbers\nWhen printing a text, numbers and other data on the console we can join them by using templates %s, %d, %f, etc. In programming, these templates are called placeholders. Depending on the type of the variable, via different symbols we declare different types of arguments. The main ones are %s for text (string), %d for integers, %f for floating-point numbers.\nHere is example for printing formatted text with (placeholders):\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nString firstName = scanner.nextLine();\nString lastName = scanner.nextLine();\nint age = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\nString town = scanner.nextLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"You are %s %s, a %d-years old person from %s.\",\n  firstName, lastName, age, town);\n\nHere is the result, which we will get after the execution of the example:\n\nPay attention to the order of variables in the System.out.printf() method. Each variable is in the order we want to print it and corresponds to the type in the placeholder. Essentially, the template (placeholder) accepts variables of every type.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#3.\nArithmetic operations\nLet’s look at the basic arithmetic operations in programming.\nSumming up numbers (operator +)\nWe can sum up numbers using the operator +:\nint a = 5;\nint b = 7;\nint sum = a + b; // the result is 12\n\nSubtracting numbers (оператор -)\nSubtracting numbers is done by the operator -:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nint a = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\nint b = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\nint result = a - b;\nSystem.out.println(result);\n\nHere is the result of the execution of the program above (with numbers 10 and 3):\n\nMultiplying numbers (operator *)\nFor multiplication of numbers we use the operator *:\nint a = 5;\nint b = 7;\nint product = a * b; // 35\n\nDividing numbers (operator /)\nWe divide numbers using the operator /. It works differently with integers and floating-point numbers.\n\nWhen we divide two integers, an integer division is applied, and the obtained output is without its fractional part. Example: 11 / 3 = 3.\nWhen we divide two numbers, and at least one of them is a floating-point number a fractional division is applied, and the obtained result is a floatting-point number, just like in math. Example 11 / 4.0 = 2.75. When division is not with exact precision, the result is being rounded, for example 11.0 / 3 = 3.66666666666667.\nThe integer division by 0 causes an exception during runtime (Java.lang.ArithmeticException).\nFloating-point number divided by 0 do not cause an exception and the result is +/- infinity or the special value NaN. Example 5 / 0.0 = ∞.\n\nHere are a few examples with the division operator:\nint a = 25;\nint i = a / 4;      // we perform the so-called integer division:\n                    // the result of this operation will be 6 - the fractional part is cut off, \n                    // as we perform division by integers\nint f = a / 4.0;    // 6.25 - fractional division. We have explicitly specified that the number 4 should be interpreted as a fraction, \n                    // adding the decimal point followed by zero\nint error = a / 0;  // Error: integer division by 0\n\nLet's look at a few examples for integer division (remember that when we divide integers in Java the result is an integer):\nint a = 25;\nSystem.out.println(a / 4);  // Integer result: 6\nSystem.out.println(a / 0);  // Error: integer division by 0\n\nLet's look at a few examples for floating numbers division. When we divide floating-point numbers, the result is always a float number and the division never fails and works correctly with the special values +∞ и -∞:\nint a = 15;\nSystem.out.println(a / 2.0);        // Fractional result: 7.5\nSystem.out.println(a / 0.0);     // Result: Infinity\nSystem.out.println(-a / 0.0);    // Result: -Infinity\nSystem.out.println(0.0 / 0.0);   // Result: NaN (Not a Number), i.e. the result \n                                 // of the operation is not a valid numeric value\n\nWhen printing the values ∞ and -∞ the console output may be ?, because the console in Windows does not work correctly with Unicode and breaks most of the non-standard symbols, letters and special characters. The example above would most probably give the following result:\n7.5\n?\n-?\nNaN\nConcatenating text and numbers\nThe operator + besides for summing up numbers, is also used for joining text (concatenation of two strings one after another). In programming, joining text with other text or with number is called \"concatenation\". Here is how we can concatenate a text with a number with the operator +:\nString firstName = \"Maria\";\nString lastName = \"Ivanova\";\nint age = 19;\nString str = firstName + \" \" + lastName + \" @ \" + age;\nSystem.out.println(str);  // Maria Ivanova @ 19\n\nHere is another example:\ndouble a = 1.5;\ndouble b = 2.5;\nString sum = \"The sum is: \" + a + b;\nSystem.out.println(sum);  // The sum is: 1.52.5\n\nDid you notice something strange? Maybe you expected the numbers a and b to be summed? Actually, the concatenation works from left to right and the result above is absolutely correct. If we want to sum the numbers we have to use brackets in order to change the order of execution of the operations:\ndouble a = 1.5;\ndouble b = 2.5;\nString sum = \"The sum is: \" + (a + b);\nSystem.out.println(sum);  // The sum is: 4\n\nNumerical expressions\nIn programming, we can calculate numerical expressions, for example:\nint expr = (3 + 5) * (4 – 2);\n\nThe standard rule for the precedence of arithmetic operations is applied: multiplying and dividing are always done before adding and subtracting. In the case of an expression in brackets, it is calculated first, but we already know all of that from math.\nExample: Calculating trapezoid area\nWrite a program that reads as input from the console the lengths of the two bases of a trapezoid and its height (one floating-point number per line) and calculates the area of the trapezoid by the standard math formula.\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\ndouble b1 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\ndouble b2 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\ndouble h = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\ndouble area = (b1 + b2) * h / 2.0;\nSystem.out.println(\"Trapezoid area = \" + area);\n\nIf we start the program and enter values for sides: 3, 4, and 5, we will obtain the following result:\n3\n4\n5\nTrapezoid area = 17.5\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#4.\nExample: Circle area and perimeter\nWrite a program that reads as input from the console a radius r of a circle, and calculates its area and perimeter.\nFormulas:\n\nArea = π * r * r\nPerimeter = 2 * π * r\nπ ≈ 3.14159265358979323846…\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter circle radius. r = \");\ndouble r = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\nSystem.out.println(\"Area = \" + Math.PI * r * r); \n  // Math.PI - built-in function in Java\nSystem.out.println(\"Perimeter = \" + 2 * Math.PI * r);\n\nLet’s test the program with radius r = 10:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#5.\nExample: 2D rectangle area\nA rectangle is given with the coordinates of two of its opposite angles. Write a program that calculates its area and perimeter:\n\nIn this tasк, we must take into account that we can obtain the length of the rectangle if we subtract the smaller x from the bigger x. Identically, if we subtract the smaller y from bigger y, we can obtain the rectangle height. Then we multiply both sides. Here is an example of an implementation of the described logic:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\ndouble x1 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\ndouble y1 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\ndouble x2 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\ndouble y2 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\n\n// Calculate the sides of the rectangle:\ndouble width = Math.max(x1, x2) - Math.min(x1, x2);\ndouble height = Math.max(y1, y2) - Math.min(y1, y2);\n\nDecimalFormat decimalFormat = new DecimalFormat(\"#.#########\");\nSystem.out.println(decimalFormat.format(width * height));\nSystem.out.println(decimalFormat.format(2 * (width + height)));\n\nWe use Math.max(a, b) to find the bigger value from a and b and identically Math.min(a, b) to find the smaller of both values.\nWhen the program is executed with the values from the coordinate system above we obtain the following result:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#6.\nWhat we have learned in this chapter?\nTo summarize what have we learned in this chapter of the book:\n\nReading a text: String str = scanner.nextLine(); (as we have written in advance Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);).\nReading an integer: int num = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());.\nReading a floating-point number: double num = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());.\nCalculations with numbers and using the relevant arithmetic operators [+, -, *, /, (, )]: int sum = 5 + 3;.\nPrinting a text by placeholders on the console: System.out.printf(\"%d + %d = %d\", 3, 5, 3 + 5);.\n\nExercises: Simple calculations\nTo consolidate our knowledge of simple calculations, let's solve several exercises.\nBlank IntelliJ IDEA solution (Project)\nWe start by creating an empty solution (Project) in IntelliJ IDEA. The solutions (project) in IntelliJ IDEA combine a group of tasks. This opportunity is very convenient when we want to work on a few projects and switch quickly between them or we want to consolidate logically a few interconnected projects.\nIn the current practical exercise we will use a Project with a couple of tasks (Java classes) to organize the solutions of the tasks from the exercises – every task in a separate Java class and all of them in a common project.\n\nWe start IntelliJ IDEA.\nWe create a new Project: [File] → [New] → [Project].\n\n\nSelect from the dialog window [Java], in the field Project SDK we specify which version of Java we will use and finally we click [Next] → [Next]:\n\n\nGive an appropriate name for the project, for example \"SimpleCalculations\" and also where to be stored our project, and after that we click [Finish]:\n\nNow we have empty IntelliJ IDEA Project (without any Java classes in it which have to be in the src folder):\n\nThe purpose of this project is to add in it .java class per problem from the exercises.\nExercise: Calculating the area of the square\nThe first task from this topic is the following: write a console program that read as input data an integer a and calculates the area of a square with side a. The task is trivial and easy: read as input data a number from the console, then multiply it by itself and print the obtained result as an output on the console.\nHints and guidelines\nWe create a new Java class in the existing IntelliJ IDEA project. On the src folder, right-click with the mouse. Choose [New] → [Java Class]:\n\nA dialogue window will open for choosing а name to the Java class, for example, “SquareArea”:\n\nWe already have a Project with Java class in it. What remains is to write the code for solving this problem. For this purpose, we write in our Java class a Main method(as in the picture below). In the body of the Main method Main(string[] args) we write the following code between the opening and closing curly brackets:\n\nAs we can see in the code above, we read as input data an integer and assign it to a variable a (line int a = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine())), afterwards we calculate the area (line int area = a * a) and finally prints the value of the variable area on the console. We start the program with [Ctrl+Shft+F10] and we test it with different input values:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#0. You have to get 100 points (completely correct solution):\n\n\nExercise: Inches to centimeters\nWrite a program that reads a number from the console (not necessarily an integer) and converts the number from inches to centimeters. For this purpose multiply the inches by 2.54 (because one inch = 2.54 centimeters).\nHints and guidelines\nFirst, we create a new Java class in the project “SimpleCalculations”. We click on the folder src and choose [New] → [Java Class]:\n\nA dialogue window appears in which we write the file’s name. In our case this is \"InchesToCentimeters\" → [OK]:\n\nNext, we have to write the program code:\n\nWe start the program with the right click on the window of the current program. We choose [Run InchesToCentim...main()] or we press [Ctrl+Shift+F10]. This shortcut starts the program in the current Java class (the one in which we wrote last):\n\nWe obtain the following result:\n\nNow let's switch to the previous program/task (\"Square Area\"). This is done by double-clicking on the file SquareArea.java from the folder src in the project [SimpleCalculations]:\n\nIf we use [Shift+F10] or press one of the two green arrows (located at the top right and bottom left of the IntelliJ IDEA window)\n\nthe last compiled program will be executed (InchesToCentimeters). We can see it as a name in the upper right corner of the window in front of one of the two green arrows:\n\nSwitching between projects is an easy task, isn't it? Choose the file with the source code of the program, double click on it and when it starts, the program from the current file runs.\nLet's test with floating-point numbers, for example, with 2.5:\n\n\nDepending on the regional settings of the operating system, it is possible to use  decimal point  (US settings) instead of  decimal comma  (BG settings).\n\n\nIf the program expects a decimal point and instead you enter a number with a decimal comma or the opposite (to enter a decimal point, when a decimal comma is expected), the following error will be produced:\n\nIt is recommended to change the settings of your computer, to use a decimal point:\n\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/649#1.\nThe solution should be accepted as a completely correct one:\n\nExercise: Greeting by name\nWrite a program that reads from the console a person's name and prints Hello, !, where  is the name entered earlier.\nHints and guidelines\nFirst, we create a new Java class with the name “Greeting” in the project “SimpleCalculations”:\n\nNext, we have to write the code of the program.

Simple Calculations – Exam Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2.2. Simple calculations - Exam tasks\nIn the previous chapter, we got familiar with the system console and how to work with it – how to read numbers from the console and print an output on the console. We went through the bacis arithmetical operations and briefly mentioned data types. In this chapter, we will practice and consolidate what we have learned so far. We will solve a few more complicated tasks given as exams tasks.\nReading numbers from the console\nBefore moving on to the examples, we will recall the most important of the material we have studied in the previous chapter. We will start with reading numbers from the console.\nReading an integer\nWe need to create a variable to store the number (for example num) and to use the standard command to read data from the console in combination with the function Integer.parseInt(…) which converts text into an integer:\nint num = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\n\nReading a floating-point number\nWe read a floating-point number the same way we read an integer, but this time we use the function double.parseDouble(…):\ndouble num = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());\n\nPrinting text using format specifiers\nThe format specifier is an expression that will be replaced with a particular value while printing the output. The method System.out.printf(…) supports printing a string using format specifiers with the following format System.out.printf(\"format-string\"[, arg1, arg2, … ]). As the first parameter of the method, we put the formatted string. As the second parameter of the method, we put so many arguments as the number of specifiers in the formatted string.\nSystem.out.printf(\"You are %s %s, a %d-years old person from %s.\",\n  firstName, lastName, age, town);\n\nArithmetic operators\nLet us recall basic arithmetic operators for simple calculations.\nOperator +\nint result = 3 + 5; // the result is 8\n\nOperator -\nint result = 3 - 5; // the result is -2\n\nOperator *\nint result = 3 * 5; // the result is 15\n\nOperator /\nint result = 7 / 3; // the result is е 2 (integer division)\ndouble result2 = 5 / 2.0; // the result is е 2.5 (fractional division)\n\nConcatenation\nWhen using the operator + between string variables (or between a string and a number), the result is so-called concatenation (cobining strings).\nString firstName = \"Ivan\";\nString lastName = \"Ivanov\";\nint age = 19;\nString str = firstName + \" \" + lastName + \" is \" + age + \" years old\";\n// Ivan Ivanov is 19 years old\n\nExam tasks\nNow, after we have recalled how to make simple calculations, read and print numbers on the console, let's move to the tasks. We will solve several tasks from a SoftUni entrance exam.\nTask: Training lab\nA training lab has a rectangular size l and w meters without columns on the inside. The classroom is divided into two parts - left and right with a hallway located approximately in the middle of the room. In both parts, there are rows with desks. In the back of the hall, there is a big entrance door. In the front, there is a podium with a chair for the teacher. A single working place occupies 70 x 120 cm (a desk with size 70 x 40 cm + space for a chair with size 70 x 80 cm). The hallway has a width of at least 100 cm. It is known that because of the entrance door (which has an opening of 160cm) exactly one working space is lost and because of the teacher's chair (which has a size of 160 x 120 cm) are lost exactly 2 working places. Write a program that reads the size of the classroom as input data and calculates the number of working places in it as it is described (look at the figure below).\nInput data\nAs input data, we will read 2 numbers from the console, each on a separate line: l (length in meters) and w (width in meters).\nConstraints: 3 ≤ w ≤ l ≤ 100.\nOutput data\nPrint on the console one integer number: the number of working places in the classroom.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nDiagram\n\n\n\n\n158.9\n129\n\n\n\n8.45.2\n39\n\n\n\n\nExplanations to the examples\nIn the first example, the training lab length is 1500 cm. There could be located 12 rows (12 * 120 cm = 1440 + 60 cm residue). The training lab width is 890 cm. From them 100 cm are for the hallway in the middle. In the rest 790 cm could be located 11 desks per row (11 * 70 cm = 770 cm + 20 cm residue). Number of working places = 12 * 11 - 3 = 132 - 3 = 129 (we have 12 rows with 11 working places = 132 minus 3 working places for podium and entrance door).\nIn the second example, the training lab length is 840 cm. There could be located 7 rows (7 * 120 cm = 840, without residue). The training lab width is 520 cm. From them 100 cm are for the hallway in the middle. In the rest 420 cm could be located 6 desks per row (6 * 70 cm = 420 cm, without residue). Number of working places = 7 * 6 - 3 = 42 - 3 = 39 (We have 7 rows with 6 working places per row = 42 minus 3 working places for podium and entrance door).\nHints and guidelines\nTry to solve the problem on your own first. If you fail, use the hints and guidelines below.\nAn idea for a solution\nIn any programming task, the important part is to build an idea for its solution before starting to write code. Let's carefully go through the problem requirements. We have to write a program that calculates the number of working places in a training lab where the number depends on the length and height of the room. We notice that the provided input data will be in meters, but we have the sizes for working places, and the hallway is in centimeters. To do the calculations, we must use the same measuring units no matter whether we choose to convert length and height into centimeters or the other data in meters. We use the first option for the presented solution.  \nNext, we have to calculate how many columns and how many rows with desks will fit in the training lab. We can calculate the columns by subtracting the width by the necessary space for the hallway (100 cm) and divide the difference by 70 cm (the length of a working place). We will find the rows by dividing the length by 120 cm. In both operations, as a result, we can receive a number with integer and fractional parts. In a variable, we should store only the integer part. In the end, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns and divide it by 3 (lost the working places because of the entrance door and podium), and we will receive the required value.\nChoosing data types\nFrom the example input data, it looks like we can get a number with integer and fractional parts. For that reason, it is not appropriate to choose int data type. Therefore we will use double. Selecting the correct data type for the variables depends on the method we choose to solve the task. Any programming task as and this one also has more than one way to be solved. We will describe two methods. \nSolution\nIt is time to go to the solution. We can divide it into three smaller tasks: \n\nRead the input.\nPerforme calculations.\nPrint the output on the console.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is read the input from the console. With scanner.nextLine() we read the values from the console and with the function Double.parseDouble(…) we convert the string (text) value into double. \n\nLet’s move to the calculations. The special part here is that after dividing the numbers, we have to store only the integer part of the result in a variable. \n\nSearch Google! Whenever we have an idea of how to solve a particular problem, but we do not know how to write it in Java, the easiest way to solve it is by looking for information on the net. If we are dealing with a problem that we assume that many other people have had before us, the easiest way to solve it is by looking for information on the Internet.\n\n\nIn this case, we can try with the following search: java get whole number part of double. We find out that one possible way is to use the method Math.floor(…). Аs the method works with double data type, we create variables of the same type for the number of rows and columns.\n\nAs a second solution, we can use: As we already know, the operator for division / operates differently on integers and floating-point numbers. When dividing integer with integer (for example int), the result is also an integer. Therefore, we can search for a way to convert the floating-point numbers of the height and the width of the training lab into integers and then divide them.\nIn this case, there could be data loss after removing the fractional part, so it is necessary for the conversion to be indicated explicitly (explicit typecasting). To indicate explicit conversion, we use the operator for converting data (type) by replacing the word type with the needed data type and place it before the variable. More for converting data types you can find out in the book \"Въведение в програмирането с Java\", стр. 119-123.\n\nWith System.out.println(…) we print the result on the console.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/650#0.\nTask: Vegetable market\nA gardener sells the harvest from his garden on the vegetable market. He sells vegetables for N BGN per kilogram and fruits for M BGN per kilogram. Write a program to calculate the earnings from the harvest in EUR (assuming that one EUR is equal to BGN 1.94).\nInput data\nAs input data, we will read 4 numbers from the console, each on a separate line:\n\nFirst line – the price of the vegetables, per kilogram – a floating-point number.\nSecond line – the price of the fruits, per kilogram – a floating-point number.\nThird line – total kilograms of vegetables – an integer.\nFourth line – total kilograms of fruits – an integer.\n\nConstraints: all numbers will be in the range of 0.00 to 1000.00.\nOutput data\nPrint on the console one floating-point number: the earnings of all fruits and vegetables in EUR.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n0.19419.41010\n101\n1.52.51010\n20.6185567010309\n\n\n\nExplanations to the first example:\n\nThe vegetables cost: 0.194 BGN * 10 kg. = 1.94 BGN\nThe fruits cost: 19.4 BGN * 10 kg.  = 194 BGN\nTotal: 195.94 BGN = 101 EUR. \n\nHints and guidelines\nFirst, we will give a few ideas and particular hints for solving the task, followed by the essential part of the code.\nAn idea for a solution\nLet's first go through the problem requirements. In this case, we have to calculate the total income from the harvest. It is equal to the sum of the profit from the fruits and vegetables, which we can calculate by multiplying the price per kilogram by the quantity. Our input data is in leva, and the output should be in EUR. According to the condition 1 Euro equals 1.94lv,so to obtain the requested output value, we have to divide the sum by 1.94.\nChoosing data types\nAfter we have a clear idea of how to solve the task, we can proceed to choose appropriate data types. Let's go through the input: we have two integers for total kilograms of vegetables and fruits, so the variables we declare to store their values will be of int. The prices of the fruits and vegetables are said to be floating-point numbers, so the variables will be of type double.\nWe can also declare two variables to store the income from the fruits and vegetables separately. As we are multiplying a variable of type int (total kilograms) with another of double type (price), and the result should also be of type double. Let's clarify that generally operators work with arguments of the same type. Therefore, to multiply values of different data types, we have to convert them into the same type.When there are different types in one expression, conversion is done to the highest type, in this case, in this case double. Because this conversion does not suggest data loss the conversion is implicit and is automatically done by the compiler.  \nThe output should also be a floating-point number. This means that the result will be stored in a variable of type double.\nSolution\nIt is time to move on to the solution. We can mentally divide it into three subtasks:\n\nRead the input.\nPerforme calculations.\nPrint the output on the console.\n\nTo read the input data, we declare variables, being careful to name them in such a way that it tells us what values the variables contain. With scanner.nextLine() we read values from the console and with the functions Integer.parseInt(…) and Double.parseDouble(…) we convert the particular string value into int and double.\n\nWe do the necessary calculations: \n\nThe task does not specify special output format, so we just need to calculate the required value and print it on the console. As in mathematics and so in programming, the division has a priority over addition. However, in this task first, we have to calculate the sum of the two input values, and then we have to divide by 1.94. To give priority to the addition, we can use brackets. With System.out.println(…), we print the output on the console.  \n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/650#1.\nTask: Change of tiles\nIt is needed to be placed tiles on the ground in front of the apartment building. The place is square with a side of N meters. The tiles are W meters wide and L meters long. There is a bench in the area with a width of M meters and a length of O meters. There is no need to put tiles under it. To place each tile requires 0.2 minutes.\nWrite a program that reads from the console the dimensions of the ground, the tiles, and the bench. Then calculates how many tiles are needed to cover the place and calculates the time to place all the tiles. \nExample: A ground with size 20 m. has area of 400 sq.m. A bench that is 1 m. wide and 2 m. long has area of 2 sq.m. One tile is 5 m. wide and 4 m. long and has area of = 20 sq.m. The area that needs to be covered is 400 - 2 = 398 sq.m. The tiles that are needed are 398 / 20 = 19.90. The needed time is 19.90 * 0.2 = 3.98 minutes.\nInput data\nAs input data, we will read 5 numbers from the console, each on a separate line:\n\nN – the length of a side of the ground within the range of [1 … 100].\nW – the width of a tile in the range of [0.1 … 10.00].\nL – the length of a tile in the range of [0.1 … 10.00].\nМ – the width of the bench in the range of [0 … 10].\nО – the length of the bench in the range of [0 … 10].\n\nOutput data\nPrint on the console two numbers, еach on a new line: number of tiles needed for the repair and the time for placing them. \nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n205412\n19.93.98\n400.80.635\n3302.08333333333660.416666666667\n\n\n\nExplanation of the example:\n\nTotal area = 20 * 20 = 400.\nBench area = 1 * 2 = 2.\nCoverage area = 400 – 2 = 398.\nTile area = 5 * 4 = 20.\nRequired tiles = 398 / 20 = 19.9.\nTime required = 19.9 * 0.2 = 3.98.\n\nHints and guidelines\nLet's make a drawing to clarify the task requirements. It can look like this:\n\nAn idea for a solution\nWe need to calculate the number of tiles to cover the ground and the time for placing them. To calculate the number of tiles, we have to calculate the area that needs to be covered and to divide it by the area per tile. The ground is square, and we find the total area using the formula N * N. After that, we calculate the area of the bench by multiplying its two sides M * O. After that, to obtain the area that needs to be cover, we subtract the area of the bench from the area of the ground.\nWe calculate the area of a single tile by multiplying its two sides with one another - W * L. As we already saied, now we have to divide the area to cove by the area of a single tile. In this way, we find the number of necessary tiles, which we multiply by 0.2 (the time needed for changing single tile). Now, we have the required output.\nChoosing data types\nInput data for the length of the side of the ground, the width, and the length of the bench are integer numbers, so to keep their values, we will declare variables of type int. For the width and the length of the tiles we will read floating-point numbers, so we will use variables of type double. The output will be a floating-point number, so used variables will be of double type. \nSolution\nAs in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three subtasks:\n\nRead the input.\nPerforme calculations.\nPrint the input on the console.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is go through the input data of the task. It is important to pay attention to the sequence of reading input data. With scanner.nextLine() we read values from the console and with Integer.parseInt(…) and Double.ParseInt(…) we convert the particular string value into int and double.\n\nOnce we have initialized the variables and saved the corresponding values in them, we proceed to the calculations. As the values of the variables n, a and b that we work with are stored in variables of type int, we can also declare for the results variables of the same type.  \n\nThe variables w and  h are of type double, so for the area of a single tile we create a variable of the same type. Finally we calculate the values that we have to print on the console. The number of needed tiles we get by dividing the area that needs to be covered by the area of a single tile. When dividing two numbers, one of which is floating-point number the result is also a floating-point number. For the calculations to be correct we store the result in a variable of type double. The task does not specify special formatting or rounding of the output, so we just print the values with System.out.println(…). \n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/650#2.\nTask: Money\nSome time ago Pesho bought bitcoins. He plans to go on a trip aroung Europe and he will need euros. Besides bitcoins, he has and Chinese yuan(CNY). Pesho wants to exchange his money in euros for the trip. Write a program that calculates how much euros he can buy depending on the following exchange rates:\n\n1 Bitcoin = 1168 BGN\n1 CNY = 0.15 USD\n1 USD = 1.76 BGN\n1 EUR = 1.95 BGN\n\nThe exchange office has a commission within 0 to 5 percent from the final amount in EUR.\nInput data\nAs input data, we will read 3 numbers from the console, each on a separate line:\n\nOn the first line – number of Bitcoins.

Floating-point number in the range of [0.00 … 5.00].\n\nOutput data\nPrint the result of the exchange of currencies on the console.

The output should be in euro. The exchange rates that we have to work with are in the task condition. We notice that we can only exchange the sum in BGN to EUR, so we have first to calculate the whole sum that Peter has in BGN and then to calculate the output. \nAs we have information for the exchange rate of Bitcoins to BGN, we can directly exchange them. On the other hand, in order to get the value of Chinese yuans in BGN, first, we have to exchange them in USD and then USD to BGN. Finally, we will sum the two values and calculate how much EUR that is. \nOnly the final step left: to calculate the commission fee and subtracting the new sum from the total one. The comission is a floating-point number, represent a percent from the total sum. Let's divide it from the beginning by 100 to calculate its percentage value. We will multiply the percentage value by the sum in EUR, and the result divides with the same sum and print the final sum on the console. \nChoosing data types\nBitcoins are given as an integer, and for their value, we can declare a variable of type int. As a number Chinese yuan and commission fee we will obtain a floating-point number, so we will use double. As double is the data type with bigger size and the output should also be a floating-point numbe, we will use it for the other variables we create. \nSolution\nAfter we have built an idea on how to solve the task and we have chosen the data types, it is time to get to write the code. As in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks: \n\nRead the input.\nPerforme calculations.\nPrint the input on the console.\n\nWe declare the variables that we are going to use and again we carefully have to choose meaningful names in such a way that it tells us what values the variables contain. We initialize their values: with scanner.nextLine(), we read the input numbers from the console and convert the string entered by the user to int or double. \n\nWe do the necessary calculations: \n\n\nFinally, we calculate the commission fee value and subtract it from the sum in EUR. Let's pay attention on this: euro -= commission * euro. It is the shortcut to write euro = euro - (commission * euro). In this case, we use a combined assignment operator -=, which subtracts the right value of the operand from the one to the left. The operator for multiplication * has a higher priority than the combined operator than the expression commission * euro is performed first. Then its value is subtracted from the value to the left of the operand.\nThe task does not specify special formatting or rounding of the result, so we just have to calculate the output and print it on the console. \n\nLet's pay attention to something that applies to all other tasks of this type: written like that, the solution of the task is pretty detailed. As the task is not too complex, we could write one complex expression, where after we read the input data, we calculate the output. For example, such an expression would look like this:\n\nThis code would print a correct result, but it is hard to read. It won't be easy to find out how it works, and whether if it contains any mistakes, as well as finding such and correcting them. It is better to instead of one complex expression, to write a few simpler ones and to store their values in variables with appropriate names. This way, the code is cleaner and easily maintainable. \nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/650#3.\nТаск: Daily earnings\nIvan is a programmer in an American company and he works from home N days per month and earns M USD per day. At the end of the year, Ivan gets a bonus which is equals 2.5 monthly salaries. From what he earned during the year, the withholding tax is 25%. Write a program that calculates the amount of Ivan's net average earning in BGN per day because he spends it in Bulgaria. We accept that one year has exactly 365 days. The exchange rate of USD to BGN will be read from the console.\nInput data\nAs input data, we will read 3 numbers from the console, each on a separate line:\n\nOn the first line – working days of the month. Integer in the range of [5 … 30].\nOn the second line – money earned per day. Floating-point number in the range of [10.00 … 2000.00].\nOn the third line – exchange rate USD to BGN /1 USD = X BGN/. Floating-point number in the range of [0.99 … 1.99].\n\nOutput data\nOn the console print average earning in BGN per day.

Then we will choose data types, and finally, we will write the code.\nAn idea for a solution\nLet's first calculate how much the monthly salary of Ivan is. We will do this by multiplying the working days per month by the money he earns per day. We multiply the result by 12 to calculate his yearly salary, and then multiply yearly salary by 2.5 to calculate the bonus. Adding the two values obtained, we will calculate his total annual income. We have to subtract 25% from it for taxes. We can do this by multiplying the total income by 0.25 and subtracting the result from it. Then we exchange the USD to BGN and divide the result by the days of a year, which we assume are 365. \nChoosing data types\nThe working days per month are given as an integer, so we can declare a variable of type int. For the earned money and for the exchange rate of USD to BGN, we will obtain a floating-point number, so for them, we use double as type. As double is the type with the bigger size and the output should also be a floating-point number, we use double for the other variables we create.\nSolution\nAgain: after we have an idea on how to solve the task, and we have considered the data types that we will use, we can start writing the code. As in the previous tasks we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks: \n\nRead the input.\nPerforme calculations.\nPrint the output on the console.\n\nWe declare the variables that we are going to use by trying to choose meaningful names. With scanner.nextLine() we read the input numbers from the console and we convert the input string to int or double with Integer/Double.parseInt/Double(…). \n\nWe do the necessary calculations:\n\nWe could write an expression that calculates the annual income without brackets as well. Multiplication is an operation that has a higher priority over addition and performs first. Despite that, it is a good practice to use brackets when using more operators because the code becomes more easily readable and chances of making a mistake are smaller. \nFinally, we have to print the result on the console. We notice that the number has to be round up to the second digit after the decimal point. For this purpose, we can use formatted specifiers, an item that will be replaced by a particular value when printing. In Java, for formatting specifier is used % followed by a specific letter (specifier). We can format an integer or a floating-point number by using F/f, or D/d. In the case of a floating-point number, before the letter, we put a dot and a whole positive number specifying the number of digits after the decimal point.\nThe final result is as follows:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/650#4.\n"},"chapter-03-simple-conditions.html":{"url":"chapter-03-simple-conditions.html","title":"3.1. Simple Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3.1 Simple Conditions\nThis chapter will discuss conditional statements in the Java language. Depending on the condition, a program may have different behavior. First will be explained the syntax of conditional operators if and if-else with appropriate examples. Then we will see in what range (scope) a variable lives. Finally, we will look through debugging techniques to track the step-by-step execution of our programs.\nVideo\n\n  Watch the video lesson about what we will learn in this chapter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXKIVmjEgHw.\n\n\nComparing numbers\nIn programming, we can compare values using the following operators:\n\nOperator  (less than)\nOperator > (greater than)\nOperator  (less than or equals)\nOperator >= (greater than or equals)\nOperator == (equas)\nOperator != (not equals)\n\nWhen comparing values, the result is of boolean type with a value true or false, depending on whether the result of the comparison is true or false.\nExamples for comparing numbers\n\nComparison operators\nIn Java, we can use the following comparison operators when comparing numbers:\n\n\nOperator description Notation\n\n\nEquals to == \n\n\nNot Equals to != \n\n\nGreater than > \n\n\nGerater than or equals >= \n\n\nLess than \n\n\nLess than or equals \n\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use comparison operators in expressions:\n\nSimple If conditions\nIn programming, we often check given conditions and perform different actions depending on the result. This is done by if conditional statement, which has the following structure:\nif (condition) {\n    // body of if conditional statement\n    // single command or block of code to be executed if the condition is true  \n}\n\nExample: Excellent grade\nRead the grade from the console and check if it is excellent (≥ 5.50).\n\nTest the code (from the example) locally. Test with different grades, like 4.75, 5.49, 5.50, and 6.00. If the grade is less than 5.50, the program will not output any result, otherwise (if the grade is greater than or equals 5.50), the program will output \"Excellent!\".\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#0.\nIf-Else conditions\nSimple if conditions could be extended with else conditional statement, which specifies a block of code to be executed, if the boolean expression (defined at the beginning if(condition)) returns false. The resulting conditional statement is called if-else construction and have the following behavior: if the condition returns positive (true) result – the code described in the curly brackets right after the if clause will be executed, otherwise if the condition returns negative (false) result – the code described in the curly brackets after the else clause will be executed. The format of the construction is:\nif (condition) {\n    // body of if construction\n        // single command or block of code to be executed if the condition is true\n} else {\n    // body of else construction\n        // single command or block of code to be executed if the condition is false\n}\n\nExample: Excellent grade or not\nLike the example above, read the grade from the console and check if it is excellent, but we should return the output in both cases.\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#1.\nThe curly brackets {} after If / Else\nWhen we have only one command in the body of the if statement, we can skip the curly brackets. When we want to execute a block of code (group of commands), curly brackets are required, because if we skip them, only the first line after the if clause will be executed.\n\nIt is a good practice to always put curly brackets, because it makes our code more readable and cleaner.\n\n\nHere is an example that skipping curly brackets leads to confusion:\n\nExecuting the above code will output the following result on the console:\n\nHere is the same example, but using curly brackets: \n\nExecuting the code with curly brackets will output the following result on the console:\n\n\nBoth use cases are correct and could be used depending on the situation and/or the specific requirements, but you always must be careful and check the expected results.\n\n\nExample: Even or odd number\nWrite a program that checks whether an integer is even or odd.\nHint and guidelines\nWe can solve the problem with one if-else statement and the operator %, which returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.\n\nExecuting the above code will output the following result:\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#2.\nExample: The greater number\nWrite a program that reads two integer numbers, from the console, and return the greater one. Print the output in the following format: “Greater number: x”, where the x is the returned number.\nHint and guidelines\nOur first task is to read both integer numbers from the console. Then we must perform the check using one if-else statement in combination with the operator for greater than (>). Part of the code is consciously blurred to test what you have learned so far.\n\nExecuting the above code will output the following result for numbers 3 and 5:\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#3.\nVariable scope\nEach variable has a scope in which it exists, called variable scope. This scope determines where the variable lives, in other words the scope where you can use it. In Java, a variable scope begins from the line in which we defined it and ends with the first closing curly bracket } (of the method, of the if statement, etc.). Thus, it is important to know that any variable defined inside the body of an if statement will not be available outside of it, unless we have defined it above in the code.\nIn the example below we will get an error, because on the last line we are trying to print the variable salary that is defined inside the if statement, and we do not have access to it outside the block (in this case we will receive notification from the IDE about variable scope).\n\nSequence of If-Else conditions\nSometimes we need to do a sequence of conditions before we decide what actions our program will execute. In such cases, we can apply the construction  if-else if… -else. For this purpose, we use the following format:\nif (condition) {\n    // body of if statement\n} else if (condition2) {\n    // body of if statement\n} else if (condition3) {\n    // body of if statement\n} … else {\n    // body of else statement\n}\n\nExample: Digits 0..9 to text\nPrint a given digit, in rage from 1 to 9, in English (the digit is read from the console). \nHint and guidelines\nFirst, we read the digit from the console. Then using a sequence of conditions we determine the corresponding English word and finally print it to the console:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint num = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\n\nif (num == 1) {\n    System.out.println(\"one\");\n} else if (num == 2) {\n    System.out.println(\"two\");\n} else if (…) {\n    …\n} else if (num == 9) {\n    System.out.println(\"nine\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"number too big\");\n}\n\nThe program logic from the above example sequentially compares the input digit from the console with the numbers from 1 to 9. Each following comparison is being performed only in case the preceding comparison is false. If none of the if statements return true, then the last else clause is executed.\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#4.\nExercises: Sequence of If-Else conditions\nTo consolidate our knowledge of the conditional statements if and if-else, let's solve several practical tasks.\nExercise: Bonus score\nAn integer is read from the console - the number of points. A bonus score adds to it according to the rules described below. Write a program that calculates the bonus score for this integer and the total number of points with the bonuses.\n\nIf the integer is up to 100 inclusive, the bonus score is 5.\nIf the integer is greater than 100, the bonus score is 20% from the integer.\nIf the integer is greater than 1000, the bonus score is 10% from the integer.\nAdditional bonus score (added separately from previous)\nIf the integer is even -> +1 bonus score\nIf the integer is odd, with last digit equals 5 -> +2 bonus score \n\n\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n20\n626\n\n\n175\n37212\n\n\n2703\n270.32973.3\n\n\n15875\n1589.517464.5\n\n\n\nWe can calculate the main and additional bonus score with a sequence of if-else-if-else statements. For the main bonus score, we have 3 cases (when the input integer is up to 100, between 100 and 1000, and greater than 1000). For the additional bonus score – 2 more cases (when the integer is even and odd, ended with 5).\n\nExecuting the above code will output the following result:\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#5.\nExercise: Summing Up seconds\nThree athletes finish in a particular number of seconds (between 1 and 50). Write a program that reads the time of each athlete from the console and calculates their total time in \"minutes:seconds\" format. Seconds need to be formatted with a zero at the front if they're less than 10 (2 -> \"02\", 7 -> \"07\", 35 -> \"35\").\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n354544\n2:04\n\n\n22734\n1:03\n\n\n505049\n2:29\n\n\n141210\n0:36\n\n\n\nHint and guidelines\nThe task has several solutions, but in the context of this chapter, we can do the following:\nFirst, sum up the three numbers to get the total result in seconds. Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, we will have to calculate the number of minutes and seconds in the range from 0 to 59:\n\nIf the result is between 0 and 59, print 0 minutes + calculated seconds.\nIf the result is between 60 and 119, print 1 minute + calculate seconds minus 60.\nIf the result is between 120 and 179, print 2 minutes + calculate seconds minus 120.\nIf the seconds are less than 10, print the number with zero in front.\n\n\nA different solution that does not use if-else statement is more appropriate because you can use it for greater time values:\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#6.\nExercise: Unit converter\nWrite a program that converts the distance between the following units: m, mm, cm, mi, in, km, ft, yd. Use the conversion table below to convert a value from one unit to another:\n\n\n\nInput Unit\nOutput Unit\n\n\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n1000 millimeters (mm)\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n100 centimeters (cm)\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n0.000621371192 miles (mi)\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n39.3700787 inches (in)\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n0.001 kilometers (km)\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n3.2808399 feet (ft)\n\n\n1 meter (m)\n1.0936133 yards (yd)\n\n\n\nThe program will receive three input lines:\n\nFirst line: a number for converting.\nSecond line: input unit.\nThird line: output unit (for the result).\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12 km ft\n39370.0788\n\n\n150 mi in\n9503999.99393599\n\n\n450 yd km\n0.41147999937455\n\n\n\nHint and guidelines\nRead the input data. We can use the toLowerCase() function, which will make all letters lowercase. As we can see from the table in the task, we can easily convert values if we use meters as our base unit. Afterwards calculate the result from the conversion of the input number in meters, performing a set of checks to define the input unit. Then calculate directly the output unit.\n\nKeep in mind that in Java, you cannot use operator == for string comparison. For this purpose, you may use the built-in functions.\n\n\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/651#7.\nDebugging\nThere were probably errors in the code you wrote so far. There is an easier way to find errors, use a tool. In the following section, we will look at one.\nWhat is \"Debugging\"?\nDebugging lets you find and resolve errors, called bugs, a lot faster. Debugging is the process that lets you track step by step the execution of a program This tracking is possible by pausing the execution of the program and analyzing its state by thorough examination, line by line. Of the logic that follows, the defined variables and how they are changed, and so on.\n\nDebugging with IntelliJ Idea\nBy pressing a combination of buttons [Shift + F9] you run the current program in debug mode. To move to the next line in the code, use the [F7] button.\n\nBy pressing a combination of buttons [CTRL + F8] you create special markers called breakpoints which suspend program execution at a specific point.\nExercises: Simple conditions\nTo get a better understanding of what we have learned, let's solve a few practical exercises.\nEmpty project in IntelliJ Idea\nCreate a new project with name Java in IntelliJ Idea and leave all other options at their default state.

Simple Conditions – Exam Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3.2. Simple Conditions – Exam tasks\nIn the previous chapter, we looked at conditional constructions in the Java language, used to perform various actions depending on a condition. We also mentioned the scope of a variable, as well as how to follow line by line the execution of our program (the so-called debugging). In this chapter, we will practice working with conditional statements, and we'll be looking at some tasks given in actual exams.

Can be used for distances at least 100 km\n\nWrite a program that enters the number of kilometers n and the period of the day (day or night) and computes  the price of the cheapest transport .\nInput data\nTwo lines are read from the console:\n\nThe first line contains the number n - number of kilometers - integer in the interval [1… 5000].\nThe second line contains the word \"day\" or \"night\" - if trip is during the day or at night.\n\nOutput data\nPrint on the console the lowest price for the specified number of kilometers.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5day\n4.65\n7night\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n25day\n2.25\n180night\n10.8\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe will read the input data and depending on the distance we will choose the cheapest transport. For this purpose, we will use several conditional statements.\nInput data processing\nOur first step is to create an object of type java.util.Scanner. We pass in its constructor the \"input stream\" (System.in) that we are going to read from. In the definition of the task, we have information about the input and output. The first two lines of the solution will contain the declaration and initialization of the two variables that will store the values of the input data.\nThe first line is mentioned to contain an integer, so the variable that will be declared is of type int. For the second line, the instruction is that it contains a word, respectively the variable is of type String.\n\nBefore we begin with the conditional statements it's necessary to declare one variable that will store the value of the transport price.\n\nExpression evaluation and computing the relevant calculations\nOnce we have declared and initialized the input data and the variable that will store the value of the price, we should assess which conditions of the task will be the first to be checked.\nIt is evident from the task that the rates of two of the vehicles do not depend on whether it is day or night, but the rate of the third transport (taxi) does. This is a reason to pick our first condition to verify whether it's day or night and determine which taxi rate will be in effect. To achieve that we declare another variable that will store the value of the taxi fare.\n\nComputing the taxi rate is performed with an if-else statement. That's how we taxi price variable is assigned a value.\n\nOnce that's done, we can now proceed to the computation of the full transportation price. Another condition for the price defined in the task is the traveling distance with a chosen vehicle. Naturally to do that we pick an if-else condition that we used to determine the price for the transport depending on the entered kilometers.\n\nFirst, we check if the kilometers are below 20 since it's specified in the task that the student could only use a taxi for destinations that are below 20 kilometers away. If the expression in the first conditional statement is evaluated to be true then the variable that stores the transportation price (price) will be assigned the corresponding value. This value is equal to the initial rate, which we sum up with its rate multiplied by the distance that the student has to travel.\nIf the expression in the first conditional statement is evaluated to false then the next step of the program is to check if the distance is below 100. The reason we're doing that is because it's possible to use a bus as a vehicle in this distance range. The price per kilometer for the bus is lower than the taxi price. Therefore, the result of the expression evaluation is true, then here's the place to assign the value of the transportation price variable (price) which equals the result of the multiplication of the distance and the bus rate.\nIn the case of the second check not returning true as a result, the program ends up in the else block and assigns a value equal to the result of the multiplication of the distance and the rate of the train. We do that because the train is the cheapest vehicle for the given distance.\nPrinting the output data\nWe have successfully computed the price of the cheapest transportation so we're almost at the end of the task. The only thing left is to print out the result that we have on the console. In our task, there's no requirement for the resulting output and that's why we choose to keep it simple and just print the variable (price).\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/652#0.\nTask: pipes in a pool\nA Pool with volume V has two filling pipes. Each pipe has a specified hourly flow rate (liters of water that pass through one pipe per hour). The worker opens the pipes at the same time and leaves the sight for N hours. Your task is to write a program that prints out the state of the pool, at the moment the worker comes back.\nInput data\nFour lines are read from the console:\n\nThe first line contains the number V - pool volume in liters - integer in the range [1… 10000].\nThe second line contains the number P1 - hourly flow rate of the first tube - integer in the interval [1 … 5000].\nThe third line contains the number P2 - hourly flow rate of the second tube - integer in the range [1 … 5000].\nThe fourth line contains the number H - number of hours that the employee is absent - a floating-point number in the interval [1.0 … 24.00].\n\nOutput data\nPrint on the console one of two possible states:\n\nHow full is the pool and each pipe's percentage contribution? Use the whole number before the decimal point of a percentage (i.e. round down).\n\"The pool is [x]% full. Pipe 1: [y]%. Pipe 2: [z]%.\"\n\n\nIf the pool has overflowed - how many liters over the pool's volume has the pool overflowed for the given time, floating-point number.\n\"For [x] hours the pool overflows with [y] liters.\"\n\\  Have in mind that due to the percentage rounding some data may be lost and it's okay for *the sum of the percentages to be 99% and not 100%.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n10001001203\nThe pool is 66% full. Pipe 1: 45%. Pipe2: 54%.\n1001001002.5\nFor 2.5 hours the pool overflows with 400 liters.\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nTo solve the task we'll read from the standard input stream, utilize several conditional statements and computations, and print our result to the console.\nInput data processing\nBy definition, our program has to have four lines that are going to read and store the input data. The first three are going to store whole numbers and this is a reason we pick the int type for those variables. On the fourth line, we are supposed to get a floating-point number and that's why the variable that we're going to use is of type double.\n\nOur next step is to declare and initialize a variable that will store the computed value for the amount of water that the pool has filled up with while the worker has been away. The calculation is made by summing up the flow rate of the two pipes and multiplying them by the input hours H.\n\nExpression evaluation and computing the relevant calculations\nOnce we have the amount of water that has passed through the pipes, the next step is to compare it with the volume of the pool.\nWe will do this with a simple if-else conditional statement, in which the condition will be whether the amount of water is less than the volume of the pool. If the check returns true, then we need to print a line that contains the ratio between the amount of water that has passed through the pipes and the volume of pool, as well as the ratio of the amount of water from each pipe to the pool volume**.\nThe ratio needs to be expressed in percentage that's why we'll multiply by 100 the result of all the prior calculations on this line. The values will be interpolated using formatting strings and rounded down to integer with Math.floor (…) (it's a requirement of the task).\n\nHowever, if the check returns false it means that the amount of water is greater than the volume of the pool, respectively it has overflowed. Again, the output must be one line but this time it should contain only two values - away time in hours of the worker and the amount of overflowed water.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/652#1.\nTask: the sleepy cat Tom\nThe cat Tom enjoys sleeping all day, unfortunately whenever his owner has some free time he comes to play with Tom. To have a good sleeping routine Tom's norm for playtime is 30 000 minutes per year*. Tom's playtime is dependant on his owner's non-working days:\n\nWhen Tom's owner is at work, Tom's playtime is 63 minutes a day.\nWhen Tom's owner has a day off, Tom's playtime is 127 minutes a day.\n\nYour task is to write a program that takes as input Tom's owner number of days off and prints out whether Tom has a satisfactory sleeping routine and how much is the difference from Tom's norm for playtime for the current year, assuming that the year has 365 days.\nExample: 20 days off → 345 working days (365 - 20 = 345). The actual playing time is 24 275 minutes (345 \\  63 + 20 \\  127). The difference from the norm is 5 725 minutes (30 000 - 24 275 = 5 725) or 95 hours and 25 minutes.\nInput data\nThe input data is read from the console and consists of an integer - Tom's owner number of days off, number in the range [0 … 365].\nOutput data\nTwo lines are to be printed on the console.\n\nIf Tom's playing time is above the norm for the current year:\nOn the first line print: \"Tom will run away\".\nOn the second line print the difference from the norm in the format:\n\"{H} hours and {M} minutes more for play\".\n\n\nIf Tom's playing time is below the norm for the current year:\nOn the first line print: \"Tom sleeps well\".\nOn the second line print the difference from the norm in the format:\n\"{H} hours and {M} minutes less for play\".\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n20\nTom sleeps well95 hours and 25 minutes less for play\n113\nTom will run away3 hours and 47 minutes for play\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nTo solve the task we'll read from the standard input stream, utilize several conditional statements and computations, and print our result to the console.\nInput data processing and relevant calculations\nThe input data will be read in a single line that will contain a whole number in the range [0 … 365]. That's why the variable that'll store the value is going to be of type int.\n\nOur first step is to calculate how many minutes in total has Tom and his master played together. The task states that not only has the sleepy cat played in days off but also on working days. The number that we read from the console is the number of non-working days.\nOur next step is to use that number to calculate how many are the working days of Tom's owner. We need this number because without it we can not get the total number of playtime minutes. The total number of days in a year is 365, the number of days off is X, which means that the number of working days is 365 - X. We will store the difference in a new variable (workingDays), which we will use only for this value.\n\nNow that we have the number of days to play, we can now calculate Tom's playing time in minutes. Its value is equal to the result of the multiplication of the working days by 63 minutes (in the task it's specified that on working days the playing time is 63 minutes per day) added to the result of the multiplication of days off and 127 minutes (in the task it's specified that on days off the playing time is 127 minutes per day).\n\nWe need to print the difference between hours and minutes. That's why we'll subtract from the total playing time Tom's playtime norm of 30 000 minutes and we'll store the result in a new variable. After that, we'll use that new variable to divide without a remainder to 60 and that's how we'll get the hours. To get the number of minutes we'll utilize the modulo operator % and get the remainder of the division by 60.\nNote that if Tom's resulting playtime is less than 30 000 when we subtract the norm we'll get a negative number. We can fix that with the method Math.abs(…) when subtracting.\n\nConditional expressions verification\nThe playing time is already calculated which leads us to the next step - Tom's playtime and Tom's norm comparison. We'll use an if-else conditional statement. It'll verify in its if clause whether the playtime is larger than 30 000 (norm).\nOutput data processing\nDepending on the result of the evaluation of the boolean expression our objective is to print the difference in hours and minutes. We'll do that using the formatting specifier and the previously computed hour and minutes values. The given output examples show that the printed values are formatted as a rounded down whole number. This is a cue that we should be using Math.floor(…) when we're printing the result.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/652#2.\nTask: harvest\nThere's a vineyard that has an area of X sq. M. . 40% of the harvest is allocated for wine production. The yield from 1sq.m. vineyard is Y kilograms of grapes. To produce 1 liter of wine is used 2.5kg grapes. The desired amount of wine for sale is Z liters.\nYour task is to write a program that calculates the possible amount of produced wine and validates if it's enough. If the production is satisfying the expectations, then the remainder shall be distributed equally among the vineyard workers.\nInput data\nFour lines are read from the console:\n\nThe first line contains the area of the vineyard X sq.m - integer in the interval [10 … 5000].\nThe second line contains the grapes yield per square meter Y - a real number in the interval [0.00 … 10.00].\nThe third line contains the desired amount of wine Z liters - an integer in the range [1 … 600].\nThe fourth line contains the number of workers - integer in the interval [1 … 20].\n\nOutput data\nThe following is expected to be printed on the console:\n\nIf the produced wine is less than the required:\n\"It will be a tough winter! More {insufficient wine} liters wine needed.\"\nThe result should be rounded down.\n\n\n\n\nIf the produced wine is sufficient:\n\"Good harvest this year! Total wine: {total wine} liters.\"\nThe result must be rounded down.\n\n\n\"{Wine left} liters left -> {wine for 1 worker} liters per person.\"\nBoth results must be rounded up.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n65021753\nGood harvest this year! Total wine: 208 liters.33 liters left → 11 liters per person.\n10201.54254\nIt will be a tough winter! More 180 liters wine needed.\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nTo solve the task we'll read from the standard input stream, utilize several conditional statements and computations, and print our result to the console.\nInput data processing and related calculations\nFirst, we need to check what input data is expected and choose an adequate type for each of the variables that will store this data.\n\nTo solve the task we need to compute the amount of wine in liters that the harvest will produce using the input data. The task defines a formula that requires the weight of the yielded grapes in kg. . We can easily calculate this by declaring a variable that will store a value equal to 40% of the result of the multiplication of the area of the vineyard and the amount of yielded grapes per square meter.\nOnce we have made these calculations, we are ready to insert them into the task formula. We declare another variable that will store the amount of wine in liters and will be equal to the weight of the yielded grapes in kg. divided by 2.5.\n\nExpression evaluation and processing the output data\nOur next step is to check if the produced wine is enough. We'll use a simple if-else conditional statement with a clause that verifies if the amount of wine in liters produced from the harvest is more than or equal to the desired liters.\nIf the expression evaluation returns true, then on the first line we should print the amount of wine produced by these harvesters. It's required that this value should be rounded down. To comply with the requirement we'll use the method Math.floor(…) when printing it using the formatting specifier.\nThe requirement for the second line is to print the interpolated values rounded up. We'll use the method Math.ceil(…). The values that we have to print are the wine that's left and the amount of wine that is to be given to each worker. The wine that's left is equal to the difference between the produced liters of wine and the desired liters of wine. As the result of this computation, we'll store in a new variable that we'll declare and initialize in the body block of the if statement before printing the first line. The amount of wine that is to be given to each worker we'll get by dividing the difference by the number of workers.\n\nIf the expression evaluation returns false, then we need to print the difference between desired liters of wine and the produced liters of wine from this harvest. It's required that this value should be rounded down. To comply with the requirement we'll use the method Math.floor(…) when printing it using the formatting specifier.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/652#3.\nTask: company\nA company is requested to develop a project that is estimated for a given number of hours. The company has a certain number of days to do that. In 10% of those days, its employees are being onboarded and are not ready to work on the project. A normal working day at this company lasts for 8 hours. The project is important for the company and every employee is obliged to work on this project overtime for 2 hours per day.\nThe hours should be rounded down (e.g. 6.98 hours are rounded to 6 hours).\nYour task is to write a program that calculates if the company is going to finish the project on time and how many hours more are needed for the completion of the project or if the execution was successful how many dedicated working hours are left at hand.\nInput data\nThree lines are read from the console:\n\nThe first line contains the necessary number of working hours - an integer in the interval [10 … 200 000].\nThe second line contains the days that the company has to finish the project - an integer in the interval [0 … 20 000].\nThe third line contains the number of all employees - an integer in the range [1 … 600].\n\nOutput data\nOne line is expected to be printed on the console:\n\nIf the time is enough:\n\"Yes! {hours left} hours left.\n\n\nIf the time is NOT enough:\n\"Not enough time! {hours needed} hours needed.\".\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n9073\nYes!99 hours left.\n9931\nNot enough time!72 hours needed.\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nTo solve the task we'll read from the standard input stream, utilize several conditional statements and computations, and print our result to the console.\nInput data processing\nFirst, we need to check what input data is expected and choose an adequate type for each of the variables that will store this data.\n\nAuxiliary calculations\nThe next step is to calculate the number of working hours. This we can do by multiplying the working days by 8 (every working day is 8 hours) and the number of the company's employees. On top of that, we should add the overtime too. The working days are equal to 90% of the days that the company has. The overtime is equal to the result of the multiplication of the employees and 2 (decided overtime length) and the number of days that the company has. We can see that the task requires the working hours to be rounded down. That's something we can easily do by using the method Math.floor(…).\n\nPerforming verifications\nOnce we've made the calculations we need to compute the value of the working hours we should check whether these hours are enough.\nIf the time is enough we print the difference between the working hours and the estimated hours for the project.\nIf the time is not enough we print the additional hours that are needed to finish the project. And that is the difference between the estimated hours and the working hours.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/652#4.\n"},"chapter-04-complex-conditions.html":{"url":"chapter-04-complex-conditions.html","title":"4.1.

Те биват наричани вложени if или if-else конструкции. Както се подразбира от названието \"вложени\", това са if или if-else конструкции, които са поставени в други if или else конструкции.\nif (условие1) {\n    if (условие2) {\n    // тяло; \n    } else {\n    // тяло;\n    }\n}\n\nВлагането на повече от три условни конструкции една в друга не се счита за добра практика и трябва да се избягва, най-вече чрез оптимизиране на структурата/алгоритъма на кода и/или чрез използването на друг вид условна конструкция, който ще разгледаме по-надолу в тази глава.\nПример: обръщение според възраст и пол\nСпоред въведени възраст (десетично число) и пол (m / f) да се отпечата обръщение:\n\n\"Mr.\" – мъж (пол \"m\") на 16 или повече години.\n\"Master\" – момче (пол \"m\") под 16 години.\n\"Ms.\" – жена (пол \"f\") на 16 или повече години.\n\"Miss\" – момиче (пол \"f\") под 16 години.\n\nПримерен вход и изход\n\n\n\nВход\nИзход\nВход\nИзход\n\n\n\n\n12f\nMiss\n17m\nMr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nВход\nИзход\nВход\nИзход\n\n\n\n\n25f\nMs.\n13.5m\nMaster\n\n\n\nРешение\nМожем да забележим, че изходът на програмата зависи от няколко неща.

Може да използваме логическо \"И\" (&&), логическо \"ИЛИ\" (||), логическо отрицание (!) и скоби (()).\nЛогическо \"И\"\nКакто видяхме, в някои задачи се налага да правим много проверки наведнъж. Но какво става, когато за да изпълним някакъв код, трябва да бъдат изпълнени повече условия и не искаме да правим отрицание (else) за всяко едно от тях? Вариантът с вложените if блокове е валиден, но кодът би изглеждал много неподреден и със сигурност - труден за четене и поддръжка.  \nЛогическо \"И\" (оператор &&) означава няколко условия да са изпълнени едновременно. В сила е следната таблица на истинност:\n\n\n\na\nb\na && b\n\n\n\n\ntruetruefalsefalse\ntruefalsetruefalse\ntruefalsefalsefalse\n\n\n\nКак работи операторът && ?\nОператорът && приема няколко булеви (условни) израза, които имат стойност true или false, и ни връща един булев израз като резултат. Използването му вместо редица вложени if блокове прави кода по-четлив, подреден и лесен за поддръжка. Но как работи, когато поставим няколко условия едно след друго? Както видяхме по-горе, логическото \"И\" връща true, само когато приема като аргументи изрази със стойност true. Съответно, когато имаме последователност от аргументи, логическото \"И\" проверява или докато свършат аргументите, или докато не срещне аргумент със стойност false. \nПример:\nboolean a = true;\nboolean b = true;\nboolean c = false;\nboolean d = true;\nboolean result = a && b && c && d;\n// false (като d не се проверява)\n\nПрограмата ще се изпълни по следния начин: започва проверката от а, прочита я и отчита, че има стойност true, след което проверява b. След като е отчелa, че a и b връщат стойност true, проверява следващия аргумент. Стига до c и отчита, че променливата има стойност false. След като програмата отчете, че аргументът c има стойност false, тя изчислява израза до c, независимо каква е стойността на d. За това проверката на d се прескача и целият израз бива изчислен като false.\n\nПример: точка в правоъгълник\nПроверка дали точка {x, y} се намира вътре в правоъгълника {x1, y1} – {x2, y2}. Входните данни се четат от конзолата и се състоят от 6 реда: десетичните числа x1, y1, x2, y2, x и y (като се гарантира, че x1  и y1 ).\nПримерен вход и изход\n\n\n\nВход\nИзход\nВизуализация\n\n\n\n\n2-31238-1\nInside\n\n\n\n\nРешение\nЕдна точка е вътрешна за даден правоъгълник, ако едновременно са изпълнени следните четири условия:\n\nТочката е надясно от лявата страна на правоъгълника.\nТочката е наляво от дясната страна на правоъгълника.\nТочката е надолу от горната страна на правоъгълника.\nТочката е нагоре от долната страна на правоъгълника.\n\n\nТестване на решението\nТествайте решението си тук: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/653#2.\nЛогическо \"ИЛИ\"\nЛогическо \"ИЛИ\" (оператор ||) означава да е изпълнено поне едно измежду няколко условия. Подобно на оператора &&, логическото \"ИЛИ\" приема няколко аргумента от булев (условен) тип и връща true или false. Лесно можем да се досетим, че получаваме като стойност true, винаги когато поне един от аргументите има стойност true. Типичен пример за логиката на този оператор е следният:\nВ училище учителят казва: \"Иван или Петър да измият дъската\". За да бъде изпълнено това условие (дъската да бъде измита), е възможно само Иван да я измие, само Петър да я измие или и двамата да го направят.\n\n\n\na\nb\na || b\n\n\n\n\ntruetruefalsefalse\ntruefalsetruefalse\ntruetruetruefalse\n\n\n\nКак работи операторът || ?\nВече научихме какво представлява логическото \"ИЛИ\". Но как всъщност се реализира? Както при логическото \"И\", програмата проверява от ляво на дясно аргументите, които са зададени. За да получим true от израза, е необходимо само един аргумент да има стойност true, съответно проверката продължава докато се срещне аргумент с такава стойност или докато не свършат аргументите.\nЕто един пример за оператора || в действие:\nboolean a = false;\nboolean b = true;\nboolean c = false;\nboolean d = true;\nboolean result = a || b || c || d;\n// true (като c и d не се проверяват)\n\nПрограмата проверява а, отчита, че има стойност false и продължава.

Също така, препоръчително e при писане да отместваме кода след if и else с една табулация навътре, за да направим кода по-лесно четим.\n\n\nУсловна конструкция switch-case\nКонструкцията switch-case работи като поредица от if-else блокове. Когато работата на програмата ни зависи от стойността на една променлива, вместо да правим последователни проверки с if-else блокове, можем да използваме условната конструкция switch. Тя се използва за избор измежду списък с възможности. Конструкцията сравнява дадена стойност с определени константи и в зависимост от резултата предприема действие.\nПроменливата, която искаме да сравняваме, поставяме в скобите след оператора switch и се нарича \"селектор\". Тук типът трябва да е сравним (числа, стрингове). Последователно започва сравняването с всяка една стойност, която се намира след case етикетите.\nПри съвпадение започва изпълнението на кода от съответното място и продължава, докато стигне оператора break. В някои програмни езици (като C# например) наличието на break е задължително за всеки case, който съдържа изпълнение на програмна логика. В Java операторът break може да се изпуска, за да се изпълнява код от друга case конструкция, докато не се стигне до следващия break оператор. Макар и позволено от езика Java, изпускането на оператор break след етикет case се налага изключително рядко и не е добра практика, тъй като води до така нареченото пропадане на програмния код. \nПри липса на съвпадение, се изпълнява default конструкцията, ако такава съществува.\nswitch (селектор) {\n\n    case стойност1:\n        конструкция;\n        break;\n    case стойност2:\n        конструкция;\n        break;\n    case стойност3:\n        конструкция;\n        break;\n    …\n    default:\n        конструкция;\n        break;\n}\n\nПример: ден от седмицата\nНека напишем програма, която принтира деня от седмицата (на английски) според въведеното число (1 … 7) или \"Error!\", ако е подаден невалиден ден.\nПримерен вход и изход\n\n\n\nВход\nИзход\n\n\n\n\n17-1\nMondaySundayError!\n\n\n\nРешение\n\n\nДобра практика е на първо място да поставяме онези case случаи, които обработват най-често случилите се ситуации, а case конструкциите, обработващи по-рядко възникващи ситуации, да оставим в края преди default конструкцията.

More Complex Conditions – Exam Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4.2. More complex conditions – Exam tasks\nIn the previous chapter, we got familiar with the nested conditional constructions in the Java language. Through them, the logic in a program can be represented by if conditional statements that are nested in each other. We also looked at the conditional switch-case construction, which allows you to choose from a list of options. We should practice and consolidate what we have learned so far by looking at a few more complex exam tasks. Before moving on to the tasks, we will recall the conditional constructions:\nNested conditions\nif (condition1) {\n    if (condition2) {\n        // body of if construction\n    } else {\n        // body of else construction\n    }\n}\n\n\n    Remember that it is not a good practice to write deeply nested conditional statements (with more than three levels of nesting). Avoid nesting of more than three conditional statements inside one another. This complicates the code and makes its reading and understanding difficult.\n\n\n\nSwitch-case conditions\nWhen the program operation depends on the value of a variable, instead of doing consecutive checks with multiple if-else blocks, we can use the switch-case conditional statement.\nswitch (selector) {\n    case value1:\n        //code to be executed\n        break;\n    case value2:\n        //code to be executed \n        break;\n    default:\n        //code to be executed \n        break;\n}\n\nThe structure consists of:\n\nSelector - an expression that is calculated to some specific value. The type of the selector can be an integer, string or enum.\nMultiple case labels followed by code to be executed, ending with break.\n\nExam tasks\nNow that we have recalled how conditional statements are used and nested into each other to implement more complex conditions and program logic, let's solve a few exam tasks.\nTask: On Time for the exam\nA student must go to the exam at a certain time (for example at 9:30am). He arrives at the exam hall at a given hour of arrival (for example 9:40). It is considered that the student has arrived on time, if he arrives at the time when the exam starts or up to half an hour earlier. If the student arrives more than 30 minutes earlier, the student has come too early. If he arrives after the time when the exam starts, he is late. \nWrite a program that has as input data for the exam starting time and the student arrival time, and prints if the student has arrive on time, or if he has arrive early or if he is late, as well as how many hours or minutes the student was early or late.\nInput data\nFrom the console, we read as input data four integers (one per line):\n\nThe first line contains exam starting time(hours) – an integer from 0 to 23.\nThe second line contains exam starting time(minutes) – an integer from 0 to 59.\nThe third line contains hour of arrival – an integer from 0 to 23.\nThe fourth line contains minutes of arrival – an integer from 0 to 59.\n\nOutput data\nPrint on the first line:\n\n\"Late\", if the student arrives later than the exam starting time.\n\"On time\", if the student arrives on time exactly at the exam starting time or up to 30 minutes earlier.\n\"Early\", if the student arrives more than 30 minutes before the exam starting time.\n\nIf the student arrives with more than one minute difference compared to the exam starting time, print on the next line:\n\n\"mm minutes before the start\" for arriving less than an hour earlier.\n\"hh:mm hours before the start\" for arriving 1 hour or earlier. Always print the minutes using two digits, for example, \"1:05\".\n\"mm minutes after the start\" for arriving less than an hour late.\n\"hh:mm hours after the start\" for arriving late with 1 hour or more. Always print the minutes using two digits, for example, \"1:03\".\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n930950\nLate20 minutes after the start\n16001500\nEarly1:00 hours before the start\n\n\n900830\nOn time30 minutes before the start\n9001030\nLate1:30 hours after the start\n\n\n14001355\nOn time5 minutes before the start\n1130812\nEarly3:18 hours before the start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n10001000\nOn time\n\n\n11301055\nEarly35 minutes before the start\n\n\n11301229\nLate59 minutes after the start\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\n\n    It is recommended that you read the condition of a task several times taking notes and sketching examples while thinking about them, before you start writing code.\n\nInput data processing\nAccording to the assignment, we expect four lines in a row with different integers. Looking at the provided parameters, we can use the type int, as it is suitable for the expected values. We simultaneously read an input and parse the string value to the selected data type for integer.\n\nLooking at the expected output, we can create variables that contain the different output data types to avoid using the so-called \"magic strings\" in the code.\n\nCalculations\nAfter reading the input data, we can now start writing the logic for calculating the result. Let's first calculate the starting time of the exam in minutes for easier and more accurate comparison.\n\nLet's also calculate the arrival time of the student.\n\nIt remains for us to calculate the difference between the two times, to determine when and what time compared to the exam time the student has arrived.\n\nOur next step is to do the required checks and calculations, and finally, we will print the output. Let's separate the code into two parts: \n\nFirst, let's show when the student arrived – is he early, late or on time. Тo do that, we will use an if-else statement.\nAfter that, we will show the time difference if the student arrives in a different time from the starting time of the exam.\n\nTo spare one additional check (else), we can, by default, assume that the student was late. \nAccording to the condition, we will check whether the difference in times is more than 30 minutes. If this is true, we assume that the student is early. If we do not match the first condition, we need to check if the difference is less than or equal to zero (), by which we are checking the condition whether the student arrived within the range of 0 to 30 minutes before the exam. \nIn all other cases, we assume that the student is late, which we did by default. Therefore, no additional check is needed.\n\nFinally, we need to find out and print what is the time difference between exam start time and student arrival time. Also, whether this difference shows the time of arrival before or after the exam start.\nWe also check whether the time difference is more than one hour, to print hours and minutes in the required format, or if it is less than one hour, to print only minutes in the required format and description. \nWe also need to do one more check – whether the time of the student arrival is before or after the exam start time.\n\nPrinting the result\nFinally, it remains to print the result on the console. According to the requirements, if the student arrived right in time (not even a minute difference), we do not need to print a second result. This is why we do the following check:\n\nPrinting the result on the console can be done at a much earlier stage – during the calculations. This, however, is not a very good practice. Why?\nLet's look at the idea that our code is not 10 lines, but 100 or 1000! One day, printing the result will not be done on the console, but will be written in a file or displayed as a web aplication. Then, on how many places in the code we need to do changes? Are you sure you won't miss some places?\n\nAlways consider the code that contains  logical calculations as a separate part different from the part that processes the input and output data. It must be able to work regardless of how the data is passed to it and where the result will be displayed.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here:  https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/654#0.\nTask: Trip\nMost people plan their vacations.

Each camping or hotel, according to the destination, has its price, which corresponds to a particular percentage of the budget:\n\nIf 100 BGN or less – somewhere in Bulgaria.\nSummer – 30% of the budget.\nWinter – 70% of the budget.\n\n\nIf 1000 BGN or less – somewhere on the Balkans.\nSummer – 40% of the budget.\nWinter – 80% of the budget.\n\n\nIf more than 1000 BGN. – somewhere in Europe.\nUpon traveling in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will spend 90% of the budget.\n\n\n\nInput data\nThe input data will be read from the console and will consist of two lines:\n\nOn the first line we receive the budget - a floating-point number int the range of [10.00 … 5000.00].\nOn the second line – one of the two possible seasons: \"summer\" or \"winter\".\n\nOutput data\nOn the console must be printed two lines.\n\nOn the first line – \"Somewhere in {destination}\", where {destination} is \"Bulgaria\", \"Balkans\" or \"Europe\".\nOn the second line – \"{Vacation type} – {Spent money}\":\nThe vacation can be \"Camp\" or \"Hotel\".\nThe amount of money has to be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n50summer\nSomewhere in BulgariaCamp - 15.00\n\n\n75winter\nSomewhere in BulgariaHotel - 52.50\n\n\n312summer\nSomewhere in BalkansCamp - 124.80\n\n\n678.53winter\nSomewhere in BalkansHotel - 542.82\n\n\n1500summer\nSomewhere in EuropeHotel - 1350.00\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nLike the other tasks, we can separate the solution of our task into the following parts: reading the input data, doing calculations, printing the result.\nInput data processing\nWhile carefully reading the requirements, we understand that we expect two lines of input data. The first parameter is a real number, for which we need to pick an appropriate variable type. For a higher level of calculation accuracy, we can pick BigDecimal as a type for the budget and string for the season. \n\n\n    Always consider, what is the **type** in the input data, as well as to what data type they need to be converted to, so created program constructs to work correctly!\n\n\nExample: When you need to do calculations related to money, use BigDecimal for a higher level of accuracy.\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for applying the logic and calculations.\n\nSimilar to the example in the previous task, we can initialize variables with some of the output results, in order to spare additional initialization.\nWhen examining once again the requirements, we notice that the decision of where the vacation will take place depends on the amount of the budget we receive as input data, i.e., in our logic, we have two cases: \n\nIf the budget is less than or equals a particular value.\nIf it is less than or equals other value or is more than the specified border value. \n\nBased on the way we arrange the logical scheme (the order in which we will check the border values), we will have more or fewer conditions in the solution. Think why!\nAfter that, we need to check the value of the given season. Based on the result, we will determine what percentage of the budget will use, and where the programmer will stay – in a hotel or a camp.\nLet's choose and create the needed format for the output data, which we will use further in the code:\nDecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat(\"0.00\");\n\nHere is a sample code that we can use to implement the described logic above:\n\nAfter, we continue with:\n\nand finish the conditions with:\n\nWe always can initialize the variable with a given value and then make only one check. This saves us a logic step.\nFor example, the following code:\n\ncan be shortened to this:\n\nPrinting the result\nIt remains to print the obtained result on the console:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/654#1.\nTask: Operations between numbers\nWrite a program that reads as input data two integers (N1 и N2) and an operator that performs a particular mathematical operation with them.  Possible operations are: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) and modular division (%). Upon adding, subtracting, and multiplying, print on the console the result and display whether it is even or odd. In simple division – only the result, and in the modular division – the remainder. You need to take into account that the divisor can be equal to zero (= 0), and dividing by zero is not possible. In this case, print a special message.\nInput data\nThe input data will be read from the console and will consist of three lines:\n\nOn the first line N1 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].\nOn the second line N2 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].\nOn the third line Operator – one character among: \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\", \"%\".\n\nOutput data\nPrint one line on the console:\n\nIf the operation is addition, subtraction or multiplying:\n\"{N1} {operator} {N2} = {output} – {even/odd}\".\n\n\nIf the operation is division:\n\"{N1} / {N2} = {output}\" – the result is formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\n\nIf the operation is modular division:\n\"{N1} % {N2} = {remainder}\".\n\n\nIn case of dividing by 0 (zero):\n\"Cannot divide {N1} by zero\".\n\n\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12312/\n123 / 12 = 10.25\n1120/\nCannot divide 112 by zero\n\n\n103%\n10 % 3 = 1\n100%\nCannot divide 10 by zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1012+\n10 + 12 = 22 - even\n\n\n101-\n10 - 1 = 9 - odd\n\n\n73*\n7 * 3 = 21 - odd\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe task is not complicated, but there are many lines of code to write.\nInput data processing\nAfter reading the condition, we understand that we expect three lines of input data. On the first two lines we expect two integers (within the specified range), and on the third line - an arithmetical symbol. \n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for the logic and calculations. In one variable, we will store the result from the calculations, and in the other one, we will use it for the final output of the program.\n\nReading the condition carefully, we understand that there are cases where we don't need to do any calculations but simply print the result.\nTherefore, we can first check if the second number is 0 (zero), whether the operation is division or modular division, and then initialize the output.\n\nLet's put the result as a value upon initializing the output parameter. This way we, can make only one check - whether it is necessary to recalculate and replace this result. \nBased on the approach that we choose, our next check will be either a simple else or a single if. In the body of this check, using additional checks, according to the submitted operator, we can divide the logic according to the structure of the expected output.\nFrom the condition we can see that for addition (+), subtraction (-) or multiplication (*) the expected output has the same structure: \"{N1} {operator} {N2} = {output} – {even/odd}\", whereas for division (/) and modular division (%) the output has a different structure.\n\nWe finish the solution by applying conditions for addition, subtraction and multiplication:\n\nFor short and clear check, such as the above example for even and odd numbers, you can use a ternary operator. Let's look at the possible check with and without ternary operator.\nWithout using a ternary operator the code is longer but easy to read:\n\nUpon using a ternary operator the code is much shorter but may require additional efforts to read and understand the logic:\n\nPrinting the output\nFinally, we need to show the calculated result to the console:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/654#2.\nTask: Game tickets\nA group of football fans decided to buy tickets for Euro 2016. The ticket price is determined according to two categories:\n\nVIP – 499.99 BGN\nNormal – 249.99 BGN\n\nThe fans have a certain budget, and the number of people in the group determines what percentage of the budget should be set aside for transport:\n\nFrom 1 to 4 – 75% of the budget\nFrom 5 to 9 – 60% of the budget\nFrom 10 to 24 – 50% of the budget\nFrom 25 to 49 – 40% of the budget\n50 or more – 25% of  the budget\n\nWrite a program that calculates, whether with the rest money from the budget they can buy tickets for the selected category, as well as how much money they will have left or will need.\nInput data\nThe input is read from the console and contains exactly 3 lines:\n\nOn the first line is the budget – a floating-point number in the range of [1 000.00 … 1 000 000.00].\nOn the second line is the category – \"VIP\" or \"Normal\".\nOn the third line is the number of people in the group – an integer in the range of [1 … 200].\n\nOutput data\nPrint one line on the console:\n\nIf the budget is enough:\n\"Yes! You have {N} leva left.\" – where N is the remaining amount of the group.\n\n\nIf the budget is not enough:\n\"Not enough money! You need {М} leva.\" – where М is the amount that is insufficient.\n\n\n\nThe amounts must be formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanations\n\n\n\n\n1000Normal1\nYes!

We need to do two different calculations. \nThe first calculations are about what part of the budget we will have to set aside for transport. For the logic of these calculations, we will notice that only the number of people in the group matters. Therefore, we will make a logical breakdown by the number of fans.\nWe will use a conditional construction - a series of if-else blocks.\n\nThe second calculations are about what amount we will need to buy tickets for the group. According to the condition, it depends only on the type of tickets, we have to buy. \nLet's use switch-case conditional construction.\n\nOnce we have calculated the transport and the tickets costs, what remains is to calculate the final result and see whether it will succeed the group of fans to attend the Euro 2016 or not with these parameters given. \nFor printing the result, in order to skip one else condition, we will assume that the group can, by default, attend Euro 2016.\n\nPrinting the result\nFinally, we need to print the calculated result on the console.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/654#3.\nTask: Hotel room\nA hotel offers two types of rooms: studio and apartment.\nWrite a program that calculates the price of the entire stay for a studio and apartment.

Finally print the result.\nInput data processing\nAccording to the condition, we expect to read two lines of input data - on the first line he month in which the stay is planned, on the second - the number of nights.\nLet's process and store the input data in appropriate variables:\n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for the calculations:\n\nLooking again at the condition, we notice that our basic logic depends on what month we receive as input data and the number of nights.\nIn general, there are different approaches and ways to make the checks in question, but let's focus on the switch-case construction, and in the different case blocks, we will use conditional statements such as if and if-else.\nLet's start with the first group of months: May and October. For these two months the price for the stay is the same for both types of accommodation - studio and apartment. Therefore, it is necessary to make an internal check against the number of nights to recalculate the corresponding price (if needed).\n\nFor the following months, the logic and the calculations are identical. \n\n\nAfter calculating the relevant prices and the total amount for the stay - let's prepare the formatted result. Before that, we should store it in our output variables - studioInfo and apartmentInfo.\n\nTo calculate the output parameters, we use the method java.math.BigDecimal.setScale(int newScale, RoundingMode roundingMode). This method rounds a decimal number to a specified number of digits after the decimal point, and we have control of any rounding type - RoundingMode. For this purpose, we give the method an integer (int) with which we indicate till which sign we want to round the number and value of a given enumeration RoundingMode (UP, DOWN, CEILING, FLOOR, HALF_UP, HALF_DOWN, HALF_EVEN). In our case, we will round the decimal number up to two digits after the decimal point with rounding type HALF_UP.\nPrinting the result\nFinally, what remains is to print the calculated results on the console.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/654#4.\n"},"chapter-05-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-05-loops.html","title":"5.1. Loops","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5.1. Repetitions (Loops)\nIn the present chapter, we will get familiar with how to repeat blocks of commands, known in software development as \"loops\". We will write several loops using the for operator in its simplest form. Finally, we will solve some practical tasks that require repeating series of actions, using loops.\nVideo\n\n  Watch the video lesson on this chapter here: \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMLI-dGB3Ms.\n\n\nRepetitions of blocks of code (for loop)\nOften in programming, we have to  execute a block of code multiple times. To do that, we use the so-called loops. Let us look at an example of a for loop that passes sequentially through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints them: \n\nThe loop starts with the operator for and passes through all values for a particular variable in a given range, for example, the numbers from 1 to 10 (included), and for each value, it performs a series of commands.\nWhen declaring the loop, an initial value and an end value are specified. The body of the loop is enclosed in curly brackets { } and represents a block of one or multiple commands. The figure below shows the structure of a for loop:\n\nIn most cases, a for loop is run from 1 to n times(for example from 1 to 10). The purpose of the loop is to pass sequentially through the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, n, and for each number to perform a particular action. In the example above, the i variable takes values from 1 to 10, and the current value is printed in the body of the loop. The loop repeats 10 times, and each of these repetitions is called an \"iteration\".\nExample: Numbers from 1 to 100\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. The program does not accept input and prints the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, each on a separate line. \nHints and guidelines\nWe can solve the task using a for loop, which will assign values from 1 to 100 to the variable i and print the numbers in the body of the loop:\n\nStart the program with [Shift+F10] and test it:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/655#0.\nYou should get 100 points (fully accurate solution).\nCode Snippet for for loop in IntelliJ IDEA\nIn software development, we regularly need to write loops dozens of times a day.

For each task, we will create a separate class.\nStart IntelliJ IDEA and select: [Create New Project].\n\nAfter that, on the left side  of the window, select Java. If the PROJECT SDK: field is empty, choose the path to the Java JDK installation directory and click on the button [Next].\n\nIn the next window, we again click on the button [Next].\n\nWe name the project (Project name:) Loops and select the directory where the project will be saved (Project location:). After that, we click on the button [Finish].\n\nIn the next window, we click on the [OK] button to create Project location if the directory doesn't exist.\n\nWe created a new project.

Check your solutions to the previous tasks again.\nIn the current task, it is better to work with fractions (not integers). The sum, the min, and the max value will also be fractions. We have to use neutral starting value in finding the min / max value, for example 1000000000.0 and -1000000000.0. If the result is equal to the neutral value, we will print “No”.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/655#10.\nTask: Equal pairs\nThere are 2 * n numbers. The first and the second form a pair, the third and the fourth number also, and so on. Each pair has a value – the sum of its numbers. Write a program that checks if all pairs have equal values.\nIf the value is the same, print \"Yes, value=…\" + the value otherwise, print the  maximum difference between two consecutive pairs in the following format - \"No, maxdiff=…\" + the maximum difference. \nThe input consists of number n, followed by 2*n integers, one per line.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n312034-1\nYes, value=3\nvalues = {3, 3, 3}equal values\n\n\n21222\nNo, maxdiff=1\nvalues = {3, 4}differences = {1}max difference = 1\n\n\n411312200\nNo, maxdiff=4\nvalues = {2, 4, 4, 0}differences = {2, 0, 4}max difference = 4\n\n\n155\nYes, value=10\nvalues = {10}one valueequal values\n\n\n2-100-1\nYes, value=-1\nvalues = {-1, -1}equal values\n\n\n2-120-1\nNo, maxdiff=2\nvalues = {1, -1}differences = {2}max difference = 2\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe read the input numbers in pairs. For each pair, we calculate the sum. While reading the input pairs, for each pair, except the first one, we have to calculate the difference with the previous one. To do that, we need to store the sum of the previous pair in a separate variable. Finally, we find the largest difference between two pairs. If it is 0, print “Yes” + the value, otherwise - “No” + the difference.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/655#11.\nExercise: Graphical and web applications\nIn the current chapter, we learned about loops as a construction in programming that allows us to repeat a given action or a group of actions many times. Now let us play with them. To do that, we will draw some figures that will consist of many repeating graphical elements. This time, we will not do it in the console but in a graphical environment using \"turtle graphics\". It will be interesting. And it is not at all complicated. Try it!\nTask: Turtle graphics GUI application\nThe purpose of the following exercise is to play with a drawing library, also known as “turtle graphics”. We will build a graphical application (GUI App) in which we will: draw different figures, moving our “turtle” across the screen via operations like \"move 100 positions forward\", \"turn 30 degrees to the right\", \"move 50 more positions forward\". The application will look approximately like this:\n\nLet us get familiar with the concept of drawing \"Turtle Graphics\". Take a look at the following sources:\n\nDefinition of “turtle graphics”: https://wiki.c2.com/?TurtleGraphics\nArticle on \"turtle graphics\" in Wikipedia – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics\nInteractive online tool for drawing with a turtle – https://blockly-games.appspot.com/turtle\n\nWe will start by creating a new Java project in IntelliJ IDEA. Add new package app (earlier in this chapter we described how to do it). Download MyTurtle.java and jturtle-0.1.1.jar from https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-Java-BG/tree/master/assets/chapter-5-1-assets. MyTurtle.java is a pre-written class, which will help us get acquainted faster with the library jturtle-0.1.1.jar, which runs the turtle. Using file explore, we copy MyTurtle.java into the directory app of the project. Then we need to add the external library jturtle-0.1.1.jar in our project. This is done as follows:\n\nSelect Project Structure from the File menu (CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + S).\nClick on Select Modules in the left pane.\nClick on the Dependencies tab.\nClick '+' → JARs or directories.\n\n\nIn the next window select the path to jturtle-0.1.1.jar and click [ОК].\n\nIn the next window, mark the box classes and click [ОК].\n\nIn the next window, click [ОК], and we are ready to open MyTurtle.java.\n\nMain methods in Turtleclass\nThese are the main actions in Turtle class with which we draw:\n\n\n\nReturn  value\nMethod and its description\n\n\n\n\nTurtle\nback(double distance) – moves the turtle back\n\n\nTurtle\nbk(double distance) – works as back(double distance)\n\n\nTurtle\nforward(double distance) – moves the turtle forward\n\n\nTurtle\nfd(double distance) – works as forward(double distance)\n\n\nTurtle\nhideTurtle() – hides the turtle\n\n\nTurtle\nht() – works as hideTurtle()\n\n\nTurtle\nhome() – moves the turtle back to its original position pointing north\n\n\nTurtle\nleft(double degrees) – rotates the turtle to the left(in degrees)\n\n\nTurtle\nlt(double degrees) – works as left(double degrees)\n\n\nTurtle\npenDown() – attaches a pen to the turtle, which leaves a line when the turtle moves\n\n\nTurtle\npd() – works as penDown()\n\n\nTurtle\npenUp() – detaches the pen from the turtle\n\n\nTurtle\npenWidth(int newWidth) – sets the width of the pen\n\n\nTurtle\nright(double degrees) – rotates the turtle to the right(in degrees)\n\n\nTurtle\nrt(double degrees) – works as right(double degrees)\n\n\nTurtle\nsetColor(Color color) – sets the color of the pen\n\n\nTurtle\nsetLineWidth(double lineWidth) – sets the thickness of the line\n\n\nTurtle\nsetPenColor(Color color) – sets the drawing colot of the pen\n\n\nTurtle\nsetPos(double x, double y) – moves the turtle to a new position with coordinates(x, y)\n\n\nTurtle\nshowTurtle() – shows the turtle\n\n\nTurtle\nst() – works as showTurtle()\n\n\nTurtle\nspeed(double newSpeed) – sets the speed of the turtle\n\n\n\nTo create a method that draws a triangle in MyTurtle.java we find the empty method drawTriangle() and write the following code: \n\nThis code moves and rotates the turtle, which is initially in the center of the screen (in the middle of the shape) and draws an equilateral triangle. \nYou can edit and play with it.\nWe start the application with [ Shift + F10]. We test it if it works (press the [Draw] button several times):\n\nNow we can change and make the code of the turtle more complicated by adding the following to our method drawTriangle(): \n\nAgain, start the application with [Shift + F10]. Test if the new program for the turtle works:\n\nNow our turtle is drawing more complex shapes.\nLet us write the code for the other two buttons: the purpose of the button [Reset] is to delete the drawn graphic and position the turtle in its starting position. We add the following code to the method resetTurtle() :\n\nThe purpose of the button [Hide / Show Turtle] is to show or hide the turtle. We add the following code to the method showTurtle() : \n\nAgain, start the application with [Shift + F10] and test whether both buttons work correctly.\nTask: * Draw a hexagon with the turtle\nAdd [Hexagon] button which draws a regular hexagon:\n\nHint:\nRepeat 6 times the following in a loop:\n\n60 degrees rotation.\nForward step of 100.\n\nAdding a new button for drawing a shape\nTo add a new button for drawing a new shape, we can trace the logic in MyTurtle.java for the button [Draw] and create a new button for drawing a Hexagon.\nFirst, we add the new figure in enum Shape:\n\nWe create a new button and add ActionListener, which assigns to shape the new enum value:\n\nThen add the new button in bList:\n\nCreate a new method drawHex() through which the turtle draws a hexagon. Mandatory at the end of the method shape = \"\" because this line will prevent the repeated execution of our method!\n\nIn Thread t add case \"Hexagon\" to call the method drawHex():\n\nTask: * Draw a star with the turtle\nAdd [Star] button, which draws a star with 5 vertices (star pentagon), as shown in the figure below:\n\nHint:\nChange the color: turtle.setPenColor(Color.green);. \nRepeat 5 times the following in a loop:\n\nForward step of 200.\n144 degrees rotation.\n\nTask: * Draw a spiral with the turtle\nAdd a [Spiral] button, which draws a spiral with 20 vertices, as shown in the figure below:\n\nHint:\nDraw in a loop by moving ahead and rotating. Gradually increase the length of the forward movement with each step and turn it 60 degrees.\nTask: * Draw a sun with the turtle\nAdd [Sun] button, which draws a sun with 36 vertices, as shown in the figure below:\n\nTask: * Draw a spiral triangles with the turtle\nAdd [Triangle] button, which draws three triangles with 22 vertices each, as shown in the figure below:\n\nHint:\nDraw in a loop by moving forward and rotating. In each step, increase the length of the forward step by 10 and rotate 120 degrees. Repeat 3 times for the three triangles.\nIf you have a problem with the exercises above, ask for help in the official SoftUni forum: https://softuni.bg/forum.\n"},"chapter-05-loops-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-05-loops-exam-problems.html","title":"5.2. Loops - Exam Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5.2. Loops – Exam Tasks\nIn the previous chapter, we learned how to execute a block of commands more than once. That’s why we introduced for loops and we looked at some of its main use cases. This chapter aims to consolidate our knowledge by solving some more complex tasks with loops, given at exams. We will show detailed solutions for some of the examples, and for the others, we will leave guidance only.\nBefore we get to work it’s best if we recall the construction of the for loop:\n\nFor loops consist of:\n\nInitialization block - executed only once at the beginning before the compiler checks the repeat condition for the first time. In this case, the variable counter (int i) is declared  and its initial value is set.\nCondition for repeatability (i ),  ran once before each iteration.\nCounter update (i++) – this code is executed after each iteration.\nLoop body - contains an arbitrary block of source code.\n\nExam Tasks\nLet’s solve some loop tasks from exams in SoftUni.\nTask: Histogram\nAn n number of whole numbers are given in the range [1 … 1000]. Some percent of them p1 are below 200, percent p2 are from 200 to 399, percent p3 are from 400 to 599, percent p4 are from 600 to 799 and the rest are p5 percent above 800 (inclusive). Write a program that calculates and prints the percentages p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5 on the console.\nExample: we have n = 20 and the numbers: 53, 7, 56, 180, 450, 920, 12, 7, 150, 250, 680, 2, 600, 200, 800, 799, 199, 46, 128, 65. We get the following distribution and visualization:\n\n\n\nGroup\nNumbers\nNumber count\nPercent\n\n\n\n\n\n53, 7, 56, 180, 12, 7, 150, 2, 199, 46, 128, 65\n12\np1 = 12 / 20 * 100 = 60.00%\n\n\n200 … 399\n250, 200\n2\np2 = 2 / 20 * 100 = 10.00%\n\n\n400 … 599\n450\n1\np3 = 1 / 20 * 100 = 5.00%\n\n\n600 … 799\n680, 600, 799\n3\np4 = 3 / 20 * 100 = 15.00%\n\n\n≥ 800\n920, 800\n2\np5 = 2 / 20 * 100 = 10.00%\n\n\n\nInput Data\nIn first line of the input, there must be a whole number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), that represents how many lines of numbers we should enter. In each of the following n lines , we have one whole number in the range [1 … 1000] – those are the numbers we use to calculate the histogram.\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console a histogram of 5 lines, each line should contain a percentage from 0% to 100%, and format it up to two digits after the decimal point (for example 25.00%, 66.67%, 57.14%).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n312999\n66.67%0.00%0.00%0.00%33.33%\n453756999\n75.00%0.00%0.00%0.00%25.00%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7800801250199399599799\n14.29%28.57%14.29%14.29%28.57%\n9367992007999993335551119\n33.33%33.33%11.11%11.11%11.11%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n14537561804509201271502506802600200\n57.14%14.29%7.14%14.29%7.14%\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe program that solves this task can be imaginatively split into three parts:\n\nReading the input data – in the current task this involves reading the number n, followed by n count of integers, each on a separate line.\nProcessing the input data – in this case, this means allocating the numbers into groups and calculating the percentage split by a group.\nPrinting the final result – printing the histogram to the console in the specified format.\n\nBefore we continue, we will take a small deviation from the current topic, namely, we will briefly mention, that in coding every variable is of some kind data type. We will use numeric data types int for whole numbers and double for real numbers in this task.\nNow we are going to proceed with the implementation of the above-made points.\nReading the input data\nBefore we move on to reading the input data we have to declare the variables, in which we are storing them. This means that we have to choose the right data type and appropriate names.\n\nIn the variable n , we will store the count of numbers, that we are going to read from the console. We choose int type, because the condition states, that n is a whole number in the range from 1 to 1000. For the variables in which we will store the percentages, we chose the double type, because they are not always expected to be whole numbers. Additionally, we declare the variables cntP1, cntP2, etc, in which we will store the count of numbers in the corresponding group, and for them, we choose the int type again.\nOnce we have declared the needed variables, we can proceed with reading the number n from the console:\n\nProcessing the input data\nIn order to read and distribute each number to its corresponding group, we will use a for loop from 0 to n (count of numbers).  Each iteration of the loop will read and distribute only one number (currentNumber) to its corresponding group. For the compiler to determine if a number belongs to a group, we perform a check in its range. If so- we add to the count of its corresponding group (cntP1, cntP2 etc.) by one.  \n\nAfter we determined how many numbers each group has, we can move on to calculating the percentage, which is the main point of the task. For this, we’ll use the following formula:\n(group percentage) = (count of numbers in group) * 100 / (count of all numbers)\n\nThis formula in the program code looks like the following:\n\nIf we divide by 100 (int number type) instead of 100.0 (double number type), the so-called integer division will be performed and only the whole part of the division will be stored in the variable,which is not the desired result. For example: 5 / 2 = 2, but 5 / 2.0 = 2.5. Taking this in mind, the formula for the first number should look like this: \n\nTo make things even clearer, let’s take a look at this example:\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n312999\n66.67%0.00%0.00%0.00%33.33%\n\n\n\nIn the case of n = 3.\nFor the loop we have:\n\ni = 0 - we read the number 1, which is less than 200 and falls in the first group (p1), and we increment the group counter (cntP1) by 1.\ni = 1 – we read the number 2, which again falls in the first group (p1) and we increment the counter (cntP1) again by 1.\ni = 2 – we read the number 999, which falls in the last group (p5), because it is greater than 800, and we increment the group counter (cntP5) by 1.\n\nAfter reading the numbers in group p1 we have 2 numbers, and in p5 we have 1 number. We have no numbers in the other groups. Applying the above formula, we calculate the percentages of each group. If we multiply within the formula by 100, instead of 100.0 we’ll attain 66% for group p1, and 33% for group p5 (there will be no fractional part).\nFinal Output\nAll that remains is to print the results. The condition states, that the percentages must be accurate to two digits after the decimal point. We can achieve this by setting the format to “%.2f%%” in the String.format(…) method:\n\nTesting using the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/656#0.\nTask: Smart Lilly\nLilly is N years old. For every birthday she receives a present. For each odd birthday (1, 3, 5, …, n), she receives toys, and for every even birthday (2, 4, 6, …, n), she receives money. For her second birthday, she received 10.00 USD., and the amount of money increases by 10.00 USD for each following even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30 etc.). Over the years Lilly secretly saved her money. Her brother ,in the years when Lilly received money, takes 1.00 USD of it. Lilly has sold the toys, received over the years, each for P USD and added the money to her savings. With the money, she wanted to buy a washing machine for X USD. Write a program that calculates how much money she has saved and if the amount is enough to buy a washing machine.\nInput Data\nThe console reads 3 numbers, each on a separate line:\n\nLilly’s age – whole number in the range of [1 … 77].\nPrice of the washing machine – number in the range of [1.00 … 10 000.00].\nUnit price per toy – whole number in the range of [0 … 40].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console a single line:\n\nIf Lilly’s money is enough:\n“Yes! {N}” – where N is the remaining money after the purchase.\n\n\nIf the money is not enough:\n“No! {М}” – where M is the insufficient amount.\n\n\nThe numbers N and M must be formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n10170.006\nYes! 5.00\nFor her first birthday, she receives a toy; 2nd -> 10 USD; 3rd -> toy; 4th  -> 10 + 10 = 20 USD; 5th -> toy; 6th -> 20 + 10 = 30 USD; 7th -> toy; 8th -> 30 + 10 = 40 USD; 9th -> toy; 10th -> 40 + 10 = 50 USD.\nShe has saved -> 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150 USD. She sold 5 toys for 6 USD each = 30 USD..\nHer brother took 1 USD 5 times = 5 USD. Remaining amount -> 150 + 30 – 5 = 175 USD.\n175 >= 170 (price of the washing machine) She was able to buy it and has a remaining amount of money 175-170 = 5 USD.\n\n\n\n211570.983\nNo! 997.98\nShe has saved 550 USD.. She sold 11 toys 3 USD each = 33 USD. Her brother has taken for 10 years 1 USD each year = 10USD. The remainder 550 + 33 – 10 = 573 USD. \n573  – she did not manage to buy a washing machine. The insufficiency amount is 1570.98–573 = 997.98 USD.\n\n\n    \n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe solution to this task, like the previous one can be split into three parts – reading the input data, processing it and printing the output.\n\nWe begin again by choosing the appropriate data types and names of the variables. Lilly’s years (age) and the toy's unit price (presentPrice) are conditionally given to be whole numbers. That’s why we’ll use the int type. For the washing machine price (priceOfWashingMachine) we know, that it is a real number and we choose double. In the code above we declare and initialize (assign a value to) the variables.\n\nTo solve the task, we will need several auxiliary variables – for the toy count (numberOfToys), for the money saved (savedMoney) and for the money she received each birthday (moneyForBirthday). The initial value of moneyForBirthday is 10, because the description states the first sum Lilly got is 10 USD.\n\nUsing a for loop we iterate through each of Lilly’s birthdays. When the counter in our loop (which equates to Lilly’s age) is an even number, this means that Lilly receives money and we add this money to her total savings accordingly. Simultaneously we subtract 1 USD - the money her brother takes. Then we increase the variable value moneyForBirthday, i.e. we increase by 10 the sum she will get on her next birthday. The opposite of that, when the counter (Lilly's age) is an odd number, we increase the toy counter. We do the parity check by division with remainder (%) by 2 – when the remainder is 0, the number is even, when we have a remainder of 1 - it is odd.\nWe also add the money from the sold toys to Lilly’s savings:\n\nFinally, we need to print the results, following the formatting specified in the condition, i.e. the sum must be rounded up to 2 digits after the decimal point:\n\nIn this case, we chose to use the conditional operator (?:) (also called a ternary operator), because it’s shorter to write. The syntax is as follows: operand1 ? operand2 : operand3. The first operand needs to be boolean type (i.e. to return true/false). If operand1 returns true, operand2 will be executed, and if it returns false – operand3 will be executed. In our case, we check if the saved money by Lilly is enough for the washing machine. If they are more or equal to the price of the washing machine, the check savedMoney >= priceOfWashingMachine will return true and will print out „Yes! …“, and if they are less the result will be false and will print “No! …”. Of course, instead of the ternary operand, we can use if-else checks.\nMore about the ternary operator: https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/ternary-operator\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/656#1.\nTask: Back to the past\nIvan is 18 years old and receives an inheritance, that consists of X sum of money and a time machine. He decides to go back to the year 1800, but he doesn’t know if the money is enough to live without working. Write a program that calculates if Ivan is going to have enough money, so he won’t need to work until a particular year (inclusive). Assuming that for every even (1800, 1802 etc.) year he will spend 12 000 dollars.

The rest of the variables are read from the console. \n\nWith the help from the for loop, we’ll iterate through all the years. We begin with year 1800 – the year that Ivan goes back to, and we get to the year he has to live to. In the loop, we check if the current year is even or odd. We achieve this by division with remainder (%) by 2. If the year is even, we subtract from the inheritance (heritage) 12000, and if it's odd, we subtract from the inheritance (heritage) 12000 + 50 * (Ivan's age).\nFinally, it remains to print the results. By performing a check if the inheritance (heritage) was enough to live without working or not. If the (heritage) is a positive number, we print: „Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left.“, and if it's a negative number: „He will need {М} dollars to survive.“. Do not forget to format the sum up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nHint: Consider using the Math.abs(…) function when printing the output if the inheritance isn’t enough.\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/656#2.\nTask: Hospital\nFor a given period of time, every day patients arrive at the hospital for an examination. The hospital initially has 7 doctors. Each doctor can treat only one patient per day, but sometimes there is a shortage of doctors, so the untreated patients are sent to other hospitals. Every third day the hospital makes calculations and if the number of untreated patients is greater than the treated patients, they hire one more doctor. The hire happens before the daily patient's admission begins.\nWrite a program, that calculates for a given period the number of treated and untreated patients.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and contains:\n\nOn the first line – the period, for which you need to make the calculations. Whole number in the range of [1 … 1000].\nOn the next lines (equal to the number of days) – patient count, who arrive for treatment at the current day. Whole number in the range of [0 … 10 000].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 2 lines:\n\nOn the first line: “Treated patients: {number of treated patients}.”\nOn the second line: “Untreated patients: {number of untreated patients}.”\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanations\n\n\n\n\n472791\nTreated patients: 23.Untreated patients: 21.\nDay 1: 7 treated and 0 untreated patients for the day\nDay 2: 7 treated and 20 untreated patients for the day\nDay 3: To this moment the treated patients are 14, and the untreated – 20 –> New doctor is hired –>\n8 treated and 1 untreated patients for the day\nDay 4: 1 treated and 0 untreated patients for the day\nIn total: 23 treated and 21 untreated patients.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n625252525252\nTreated patients: 40.Untreated patients: 87.\n\n\n3777\nTreated patients: 21.Untreated patients: 0.\n\n\n    \n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe start again, by declaring and initializing the necessary variables: \n\nThe period which we have to make the calculations is read from the console and we store it in the variable period. We are going to need also some auxiliary variables: number of treated patients (treatedPatients), number of untreated patients (untreatedPatients) and the number of doctors (countOfDoctors), which by default is 7.\n\nUsing a for loop, we iterate through all days in the given period (period). For each day, we read from the console the number of patients (currentPatients). Incrementing the number of doctors by condition can be done every third day, BUT if only the number of the untreated patients is greater than the treated ones. For this purpose, we check if the day is the third one, using the arithmetical operator for division with remainder (%): day % 3 == 0.\nFor example:\n\nIf it’s the third one, the remainder from the division by 3 will be 0 (3 % 3 = 0) and the check day % 3 == 0 will return true.\nIf it’s the second one, the remainder from the division by 3 will be 2 (2 % 3 = 2) and the check will return false.\nIf it’s the forth one, the remainder from the division will be 1 (4 % 3 = 1) and again the check will return false.\n\nIf the check day % 3 == 0 returns true, the program will check if the untreated patient’s count is greater than the treated ones: untreatedPatients > treatedPatients. If again the result is true, then we’ll increase the number of doctors (countOfDoctors).\nAfter that, we check the number of patients for the day (currentPatients) whether it’s greater than the number of doctors (countOfDoctors). If the patient number is greater:\n\nWe increase the value of the variable treatedPatients with the number of doctors (countOfDoctors).\nWe increase the value of the variable untreatdPatients with the number of the rest of the patients, which we calculate, by subtracting the number of the doctors from all the patients (currentPatients - countOfDoctors).\n\nIf the patient count is less, we increase only the variable treatedPatients with the number of patients for the day (currentPatients).\nFinally, we only need to print the number of treated and untreated patients.\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/656#3.\nTask: Division without remainder\nThere are n whole numbers given in the range of [1 … 1000].

Therefore, we can start with declaring the needed variables:\nExemplary names for the variables can be: n – count of the numbers (that we have to read from the console) and divisibleBy2, divisibleBy3, divisibleBy4 – auxiliary variables, containing the count of numbers in the corresponding group.\nTo read and assign every number in its corresponding group, we should iterate the for loop from 0 to n (count of numbers). Each iteration of the loop must read and allocate only one number. The difference here is that a number can end up in multiple groups simultaneously, that’s why we should create three separate if statements for each number – respectively whether it is divisible by 2, 3 and 4 (the if-else statement, in this case, won’t be useful because after finding a match it stops further checking of conditions) and increase the value of the variable that keeps the count of numbers for the corresponding group.\nFinally, we have to print out the obtained results, by following the specified formatting.\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/656#4.\nTask: Logistics\nIt’s your responsibility for the logistics of various types of cargo. Depending on the weight of each load, a different vehicle type is needed, and the costs will vary per ton:\n\nUp to 3 tons – van (200 USD per ton).\nUpward of 3 and up to 11 tons – lorry (175 USD per ton).\nOver 11 tons – train (120 USD per ton).\n\nIt’s your task to calculate, the average price per ton of transported cargo, and also what percentage of cargo is transported by the various vehicle types.\nInput Data\nFrom the console, we must read a sequence of numbers, each on a separate line:\n\nFirst line: cargo count for transport – whole number in the range of [1 … 1000].\nOn each of the next lines, we input the weight of the current cargo – whole number in the range of [1 … 1000].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint out on the console 4 lines, as follows:\n\nLine #1 – average price per ton of cargo (rounded up to the second symbol after the decimal point).\nLine #2 – percentage of cargo, transported by van (between 0.00% and 100.00%, rounded up to the second symbol after the decimal point).\nLine #3 – percentage of cargo, transported by lorry (between 0.00% and 100.00%).\nLine #4 – percentage of cargo, transported by train (between 0.00% and 100.00%).\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanations\n\n\n\n\n415163\n143.8016.00%20.00%64.00%\n\nTwo of the cargoes are transported by van 1 + 3, in total 4 tons.\nOne of the shipments is transported by lorry: 5 tons.\nOne of the shipments is transported by train: 16 tons.\nThe sum of all the cargo is: 1 + 5 + 16 + 3 = 25 tons.\nPercentage cargo by van: 4/25*100 = 16.00%\nPercentage cargo by lorry: 5/25*100 = 20.00%\nPercentage cargo by train: 16/25*100 = 64.00%\nAverage price per ton of transported cargo: (4 * 200 + 5 * 175 + 16 * 120) / 25 = 143.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n52102017\n149.387.50%42.50%50.00%\n453756999\n120.350.00%0.63%99.37%\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst we have to read the weight of each cargo and will sum up how many tons are transported by van, lorry and train and we are going to calculate the total tons of transported cargo. We will calculate the prices for each type of transport determined by the total transported tonnage and the total price. In the end, we’ll calculate and print the total average price per ton and how much cargo is being transported by each transport type.\nWe declare the needed variables, for example: countOfLoads – the number of loads to be transported (we read them from the console), sumOfTons – the sum of the total weight of all cargo, vanTons, truckTons, trainTons – variables that keep the sum of the weight, transported by van, lorry and train.\nWe are going to need a for loop from 0 to countOfLoads-1 to iterate through all the shipments. For each shipment, we read its weight (in tons) from the console and we save it to a variable, for example, tons. We add up to the tonnage sum of all cargos (sumOfTons) the weight of the current load (tons). After we’ve read the weight of the current cargo, we have to determine which transportation type we are going to use for it (van, lorry or train). For this task, we’re going to need if-else statements:\n\nIf the value of the variable tons is less than 3, increase the value of vanTons by the value of tons: \nvanTons += tons;\n\n\nOtherwise, if the value of tons is up to 11, we increase truckTons by tons.\n\nIf tons is more than 11, we increase trainTons by tons.\n\nBefore we print out the output, we have to calculate the tonnage percentage of each transportation type and the average price per ton. For the average price, we are going to need one more auxiliary variable totalPrice, in which we are going to add up the total price of all transported cargo (by van, lorry and train). For us to get the average price, we have to divide totalPrice by sumOfTons. It remains to calculate the percentages of the tonnage, transported by each transport type, and printing out the results, adhering to the formatting specified in the description.\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/656#5.\n"},"chapter-06-nested-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-06-nested-loops.html","title":"6.1. Nested Loops","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6.1 Nested Loops\nThis chapter will discuss nested loops in Java language.

In Chapter 10, we will look in detail at what methods are and how to use them. The method will allow us to execute the same code more than once and in more than one place in a program. At this stage, we will not reveal more than the concept of methods.\n\nHow does the example work? The control variable of the loop (i = 0) is initialized. The variable is incremented on each iteration, as long as it is less than 10. After each execution of the code in the loop body, and after the iteration, a check about the state of the variable is performed. Thus the code in the loop body is executed exactly ten times i.e. for each row of the rectangle. In the loop body, we call the method generateFrom. The method uses the class StringBuffer and another for loop. Each iteration of a for loop (the one in the method) will append one asterisk, thus creating a row of ten asterisks. When the whole execution of the loop (the one in the method) finishes, we have a string of asterisks as a result. Then, the execution of the code returns to the point where we call the method. Then, prints the resulting string on the console.\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/657#0.\nExample: A rectangle with a size of N x N asterisks\nWrite a program that reads an integer n from the console, and as output, draws a rectangle with a size of n x n asterisks.\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n****\n3\n*********\n4\n****************\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nTo perform the task, we will use the Scanner class, which allows us to read the input size of the figure from the console. \n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/657#1.\nNested Loops\nNested loops are construction in which in the body of one loop statement (called outer), another loop statement is performed (called inner). For each iteration of the outer loop statement, the inner one is executed completely. This happens as follows:\n\n\nWhen the execution of nested loops begin, the outer loop starts first which includes the following steps: the control variable is initialized, then checks the condition for the end of the loop, and then the code in the body starts to execute.\nThen the inner loop is executed, which includes the same steps: the control variable is initialized, then checks the condition for the end of the loop, and then the code in the body starts to execute.\nWhen the condition for the end of the inner loop is met, the program returns one step up, and the started execution of the outer loop continues. This results that the variable of the outer loop is changing (incremented), then checks whether the end condition of the outer loop is satisfied. If not, a new execution of the nested (inner) loop starts.\nThis is repeated until the outer loop variable reaches the end of loop condition.\n\nHere is an example that illustrates the nested loops. The goal is to print a rectangle of n x n asterisks, where for each row, the outer loop iterates from 1 to n, and for each column iterates an inner loop from 1 to n:\n\nHow does the above example work? After the initialization of the outer loop, its body begins to execute, which contains another (inner) loop. The inner loop returns numberOfstars as a string of asterisks. After the inner loop completes its execution, the program control returns at the first iteration of the outer loop, and the code within it continues to execute. A statement (System.out.println ()) exists in the body of the outer loop. This statement will move the cursor to the following line when the inner loop completes its execution. Without this code, we will print all asterisks on one line. Usage of println() method in the inner loop instead of the print() method will print all asterisks on separate lines. You can try and see for yourself. Then increment of the variable (in our case by 1) of the outer loop follows, and the whole inner loop starts execution again. The inner loop executes as many times as the body of the outer loop is executed (in our case numberOfstars times).\nExample: A square with a size of 10 x 10 asterisks\nWrite a program that draws on the console a square of N x N asterisks: \n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n* ** *\n3\n* * ** * ** * *\n4\n* * * ** * * ** * * ** * * *\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe task is similar to the previous one.

We will use nested loops again, but there is a trick here. The difference is that the number of columns we need to print as output depends on the row we are on, not the input integer n. From the sample input and output data, we notice that the number of dollars depends on which line we are at the time of printing, i.e. one dollar sign means at the first line, two dollar signs at the second line, etc. Let's look at the example below in more detail. We see that the variable of the nested loop is bound to the variable of the outer loop. In this way, our program prints the desired triangle.\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/657#3.\nExample: Square frame\nWrite a program that reads an integer number n from the console and returns as output a square frame with a size of n * n.\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n+ - +| - |+ - +\n4\n+ - - +| - - || - - |+ - - +\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5\n+ - - - +| - - - || - - - || - - - |+ - - - +\n6\n+ - - - - +| - - - - || - - - - || - - - - || - - - - |+ - - - - +\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe can solve the task as follows:\n\nWe read an integer n from the console.\nWe print the upper part of the frame: first the sign +, then n-2 times the sign - and finally the sign +.\nWe print the middle part of the frame: we print n-2 lines as first print the sign |, then n-2 times the sign - and finally again the sign |.

If you are making more complex programs, it is a good practice to check the input data.\n\n\nTo draw the roof, we write down how many asterisks we start within a variable called stars:\n\nIf n is even, they are two.\nIf n is odd it is one\n\n\nWe calculate the length of the roof, and it equals half of n. Assign the result to the variable *roofLength.\n\nIt is important to note that when n is an odd number, the length of the roof is one row bigger than the base one. In Java, when you divide two numbers of integer type with a remainder, the result will be a number without a remainder.\nExample:\nint result = 3 / 2; // result: 1\n\nIf we want to round up the result, we need to use the method Math.ceil(…): \nint result = (int) Math.ceil(3 / 2f);\n\nIn this example, the division is not between two integers. The letter \"f\" after a number shows that this number is of float type (a floating-point number). The result of 3 / 2f is 1.5f. Math.ceil(…) method rounds up the result and, in this case, 1.5f will become 2. We write (int) before Math.ceil(…), so we can transfer the result back to int type and assign it to the variable result.\nAfter we have calculated the length of the roof, we use a loop from 0 to roofLength. On each iteration we will:\n\nCalculate the number of dashes we need to draw. The number will be equal to (n - stars) / 2. Assign it in variable padding.\n\n\n\nPrint on the console: \"dashes\" (padding times) + \"asterisks\" (stars times) + \"dashes\" (padding* times).\n\n\n\nBefore the iteration is over, we add 2 to stars (the number of the asterisks).\n\n\n\nIt is not a good practice to concatenate many character strings as it is shown above, because this leads to performance issues. Learn more at: https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/Низ#String_Builder\n\n\nAfter we have finished with the roof, it is time for the base. It is easier to print:\n\nWe use loop from 0 to n (not inclusive).\nWe print on the console: | + * (n - 2 times) + |.\n\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/657#8.\nExample: Diamond\nWrite a program that reads an integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) from the console and returns as output a diamond with a size of n, just like the examples below.\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1\n*\n2\n**\n3\n-*-*-*-*-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n-**-*--*-**-\n5\n--*---*-*-*---*-*-*---*--\n6\n--**---*--*-*----*-*--*---**--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n---*-----*-*---*---*-*-----*-*---*---*-*-----*---\n8\n---**-----*--*---*----*-*------*-*----*---*--*-----**---\n9\n----*-------*-*-----*---*---*-----*-*-------*-*-----*---*---*-----*-*-------*----\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nAccording to the requirements of the task, have n rows and n columns to draw a diamond, but from the input and output data, we can see the following:\n\nAll lines contain exactly n characters, and all lines, except the upper and the bottom ones, have two asterisks (*).\n\nWe can divide (imaginary) the diamond into two parts: \n\nUpper part. It starts from the top to the middle of the diamond (includes and the middle row).\nLower part. It starts from the row after the middle up to the bottom tip (inclusive) of the diamond.\n\nUpper part\n\nIf n is odd, begins with 1 asterisk (*).\nIf n is even, begins with 2 asterisks (``**).\nWith each row down, the asterisks move away from each other.\nThe space infront, between, and after the asterisks (*) is filled with dashes (-). \n\nLower part\n\nWith each row down, the asterisks come together. It means that the space (dashes) between them decreases, and the space (dashes) on the left and right increases.\nAt its bottom, it has 1 or 2 asterisks, depending on whether n is odd or even.\n\nUpper and lower part\n\nOn each row, the asterisks are surrounded from the outer side (the left or the right one) by dashes, except the middle row.\nEach row has a space between the two asterisks, except the first and last row (sometimes the asterisk is one).\n\nReading the Input Data\nWe read an integer n from the console and assign the value of an integer to a variable of type int. \n\nPrinting the upper part of the diamond\nWe begin drawing the upper part of the diamond. The first thing we need to do is to calculate the number of the outer dashes leftRight (the dashes on the outer side of the asterisks). It is equal to (n - 1) / 2, rounded downward.\n\nAfter we have calculated leftRight, we start drawing the upper part of the diamond. We can use a loop from 0* to n / 2 + 1** (rounded downward).\nAt each iteration of the loop the following steps are performed:\n\nWe draw as an output on the console dashes on the left side of the diamond (with length equals to leftRight) and right after them the first asterisk.\n\n\n\nWe will calculate the distance between the two asterisks. We can do this by subtracting from n the number of the outer dashes and the number 2 (the number of the asterisks, i.e. the diamond's outline). The result of the subtraction assign to a variable mid.\n\n\n\nIf mid is lower than 0, we know that on the row should be only 1 asterisk. If it is higher or equal to 0 then we have to print dashes with length equal to mid and one asterisk after them.\nWe draw as an output on the console dashes on the right side of the diamond with length equal to leftRight.\n\n\n\nIn the end of the loop we decrease leftRight by 1 (the asterisks * are moving away from each other).\n\nWe are ready with the upper part.\nPrinting the lower part of the diamond\nPrinting the lower part is similar to that of the upper part. The differences are: \n\nIncrease instead of decrease leftRight with one, but at the beginning of the loop\nThe loop will be from 0 to (n - 1) / 2.\n\n\n\nRepeating a code is considered bad practice, because the code becomes very hard to maintain. Let's imagine that we have a piece of code (e.g. the logic for drawing a row from the diamond example) at a few more places and we decide to change it. For this we will have to go through all the places and change it everywhere. Now let's imagine that you need to reuse a piece of code not 1, 2 or 3 times but tens of times. A way to overcome this problem is to use methods. You can look for additional information for methods in the Internet or to look at  Chapter “10” (Methods).\n\n\nTest the code in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/657#9.\nWhat we learned in this chapter?\nWe learned to draw figures with nested for loops:\nfor (int r = 1; r \nWe also learned that we can use methods to avoid repeating the code multiple times. \n"},"chapter-06-nested-loops-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-06-nested-loops-exam-problems.html","title":"6.2.

Nested Loops – Exam Tasks\nIn the previous chapter we got familiar with nested loops and to use them drawing different kinds of figures on the console.

The left and right columns on the inside are n / 2 wide.\nInput Data\nThe input is an integer n in the range of [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console n text rows, depicting the fortress, exactly like the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n/^\\/^\\|    |\\_/\\_/\n4\n/^^\\/^^\\|      ||      |\\__/\\__/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5\n/^^\\__/^^\\|        ||        ||   __   |\\__/  \\__/\n8\n/^^^^\\____/^^^^\\|              ||              ||              ||              ||              ||     ____     |\\____/    \\____/\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the task statement we see that the input data will be one line only containing an integer within the range [3 … 1000]. Therefore, we will use a variable of type int.\n\nOnce we have declared and initialized the input data, we need to divide the fort into three parts:\n\nroof\nbody\nbase\n\nWe can see from the examples that the roof is made of two towers and a middle part. Each tower has a beginning /, a middle part ^ and an end \\.\n\n\\ is a special symbol in Java. Using it in the System.out.println(…) method, the console will not print it. That's why using \\\\ we instruct the console that we want to print exactly this symbol, without being interpreted as a special one (it is shielded- this is called “character escaping”).\n\n\nThe size of the middle part is n / 2, therefore we can write this value in a new variable. It will store the size of the middle part of the tower.\n\nNow we declare a second variable, where we will store the value of between the two towers part. The middle roof part has size of 2 * n - 2 * colSize - 4.\n\nIn order to print the roof on the console, we will use our repeatStr(…) method, which accepts two parameters (string, int) and concatenate a certain symbol (or series of characters) n times.\n\nThe fort body contains a beginning |, a middle part (white space) and an end |. The middle part is a blank space with size of 2 * n – 2. The number of the rows used for walls could be found by the given parameters - n - 3.\n\nIn order to draw the last row, which is a part of the base, we need to print the beginning |, the middle part (white space)_(white space) and an end |. To do this, we can use the declared colSize and midSize variables, because we can see from the examples that they are equal to the _ symbol in the roof.\n\nWe add to the values of the blank spaces + 1, because we have one blank space more in the examples.\nThe fort’s base structure is same as the roof one.

For this reason, we will use a variable of type int.\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper wing  ,  body and lower wing . In order to draw the upper wing, we need to divide it into parts - a beginning *, a middle part \\ / and an end *. After looking at the examples we can say that the beginning has size n - 2.\n\nWe also see that the upper wing of the butterfly is of size n - 2, so we can make a loop that iterates halfRowSize times.\n\nFrom the examples we can notice that on an even row we have a beginning -, a middle part \\ / and an end *, and on an odd line - a beginning *, a middle part \\ / and an end -. Therefore, we need to do an if-else condition to check whether the line is even or odd and print one of the two types of lines accordingly.\n\nTo create the body of the butterfly , we can use again the  halfRowSize variable  and print exactly one line on the console. The body structure has a beginning (white space), a middle @ and an end (white space).\n\nIt remains to print the lower wing on the console, which is identical to the upper wing. \n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/658#1.\nTask: \"Stop\" Sign\nWrite a program that reads an integer n from the console and draws a STOP warning sign with size as in the example below.\nInput Data\nThe input is an integer N in the range of [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint text lines on the console depicting the STOP warning sign, just as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n...._______.......//_____\\\\.....//_______\\\\...//_________\\\\.//___STOP!___\\\\\\\\___________//.\\\\_________//...\\\\_______//..\n6\n......._____________.............//___________\\\\...........//_____________\\\\.........//_______________\\\\.......//_________________\\\\.....//___________________\\\\...//_____________________\\\\.//_________STOP!_________\\\\\\\\_______________________//.\\\\_____________________//...\\\\___________________//.....\\\\_________________//.......\\\\_______________//.........\\\\\\___________//.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n........_______________...............//_____________\\\\.............//_______________\\\\...........//_________________\\\\.........//___________________\\\\.......//_____________________\\\\.....//_______________________\\\\...//_________________________\\\\.//___________STOP!___________\\\\\\\\___________________________//.\\\\_________________________//...\\\\_______________________//.....\\\\_____________________//.......\\\\___________________//.........\\\\_________________//...........\\\\_______________//......\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the task statement we see that the input data will be read from only one line which contains an integer in the range of [3 … 1000]. Therefore, we will use a variable of type int.\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper, middle and lower. The upper part consists of two sub-parts - an initial line and lines in which the character expands. The start row is composed of a beginning ., a middle part _ and an end .. After looking at the examples we can say that the beginning is of size n + 1 and it is better to to separate this value into a separate variable.\n\nWe need to create a second variable in which we will store the value of the middle of the initial row and is of size 2 * n + 1.\n\nOnce we have declared and initialized the two variables, we can print the start line to the console. Let's not forget to pass a new line to the console with System.out.println(…).\n\nIn order to draw the lines where the sign is getting \"wider\", we have to create a loop, that iterates n number of times. The structure of a line consists of a beginning ., // + middle part _ + \\\\ and an end .. In order to be able to reuse the created variables , we need to decrease the dots by 1 and the underscores by 2, because we have already printed the first row, and the dots and underscores in the next line of the figure decrease. \n\nAt each subsequent iteration the beginning and the end  decreasing with 1, and the middle part increases by 2.\n\nThe middle part of the figure has a beginning // + _, a middle part STOP! and an end _ + \\\\. The count of the underscores _ is (underscores - 5) / 2.\n\nThe lower part of the figure where the sign decreases, can be done by creating a loop again, which iterates n number of times. The structure of a single line is a beginning . + \\\\, a middle part _ and an end // + .. The number of the dots in the first iteration of the loop should be 0 and increases by one on each subsequent iteration. Therefore, we can say that the size of the dots in the lower part of the figure is equal to i.\n\nFor our program to work properly, we need to reduce the number of i by 2 at each iteration of the loop.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/658#2.\nTask: Arrow\nWrite a program that reads an odd integer n from the console and draws a vertical arrow pointing down, with dimensions as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input is an odd integer number n in the range of [3 … 79].\nOutput Data\nPrint a vertical arrow on the console with \"#\" (hash) outlining the arrow and \".\" outlining the rest.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n.###..#.#.##.##.#.#...#..\n5\n..#####....#...#....#...#....#...#..###...###.#.....#...#...#.....#.#.......#....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n9\n....#########........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#....#####.......#####.#.............#...#...........#.....#.........#.......#.......#.........#.....#...........#...#.............#.#...............#........\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the task condition, we see that the input data will be read from only one line which contains an integer in the range of [3 … 79]. Therefore, we will use a variable of type int.\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper, middle and lower. The upper part consists of two subparts – the initial row and the arrow body. From the examples we see that the number of the outer dots in the initial row and in the arrow body are (n - 1) / 2. We can store this value in a  outerDots variable.\n\nThe number of the internal dots in the arrow body is (n - 2). We need to create a variable named innerDots, which will store this value.\n\nWe can see from the examples the structure of the initial line. We must use the outerDots and n variables declared and initialized by us to print the starting row. We must remember that we have to move to a new line with System.out.println();.\n\nIn order to draw on the arrow's body on the console , we have to create a loop, which iterates n - 2 times.\n\nThe middle part of the figure consists of a beginning #, a middle part . and an end #. We see from the examples that the number of the # is equal to outerDots increased by 1 and that is why we can use the same variable again.\n\nTo draw the the arrow’s lower part, we need to assign new values to the variables outerDots and innerDots.\n\nThe loop, we are going to make must iterates n - 2times and we need to print the last row of the figure separately. On each iteration outerDots increases by 1, and innerDots decreases by 2.\n\nThe last row of our figure is made of a beginning ., a middle part # and an end .. The number of the . is equal to outerDots.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/658#3.\nTask: Axe\nWrite a program that takes as an input an integer n and draws an axe with size as shown below. \nThe axe is 5 * N columns wide.\nInput Data\nThe input is an integer n in the range of [2..42].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console an axe, exactly like the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n------**--------*-*-*******-*-------***-\n5\n---------------**-----------------------*-*----------------------*--*---------------------*---*--------------------*----*----****************----*----****************----*-------------------*----*------------------********---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n8\n------------------------**--------------------------------------*-*-------------------------------------*--*------------------------------------*---*-----------------------------------*----*----------------------------------*-----*---------------------------------*------*--------------------------------*-------*-------*************************-------*-------*************************-------*-------*************************-------*-------*************************-------*-------------------------------*-------*------------------------------*---------*----------------------------*-----------*--------------------------***************----\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIn order to solve the task, we first need to calculate the dashes on the left, the middle dashes, the dashes on the right and the whole length of the figure.\n\nOnce we have declared and initialized the variables, we can begin drawing the figure by starting with the upper part. From the examples, we can figure out the structure of the first row and to create a loop that iterates n number of times. At each iteration of the loop the middle dashes increase by 1, and the dashes on the right decrease by 1.\n\nIn order to be able to reuse the created variables when drawing the axe’s handle, we need to decrease the middle dashes by 1, and increase the dashes on the right by 1.\n\nWe can draw the handle of the axe by iterating the loop n - 2 times. From the examples we can understand what its structure is. \n\nThe lower part of the figure we have to divide into 2 subparts - the head of the axe and the last row of the figure. We will print the axe’s head on the console by creating a loop that repeats n / 2 - 1 number of times.

More complex loops\nHaving learned what for loops are and what they serve for, it is now time to get to know other types of loops and some more complex loops constructs.

In this topic, we will pay attention to a specific and very important part of its construction, namely the step. \nWhat is a step?\nThe step is that part of the for loop construction that states how much to increase or decrease the value of its leading variable.  It is declared last in the  for loop block.\nIt most often has a size 1 and in that case instead of writing i += 1 or i -= 1, we can use the i++ or i-- operators. If we want the step to be different than 1, we use the operator i += (step size) to increment and i -= (step size) to decrement. For a step size of 10, the loop would look like this:\n\nThe following is a series of examples, the solution of which will help us better understand the use of the step in the for loop.\nExample: Numbers from 1 to N with step 3\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n with a step 3. For example, if n = 100, the result will be 1, 4, 7, 10, …, 94, 97, 100. \nWe can solve the task through the following sequence of actions (algorithm):\n\nWe read the number n from the console input.\nWe run a for loop from 1 to n with a step size of 3.\nWe print the value of the current step in the body of the loop.\n\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#0.\nExample: Numbers from N to 1 in reverse order\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from n to 1 in reverse order (step -1).

What is specific about them is that they repeat a block of commands, as long as a given condition is true. Their structure differs from the for loops, and they even have a simplified syntax.\nWhat is a while loop?\nIn programming, the while loop is used when we want to repeat the execution of a certain logic while a given condition is met. We define 'condition' as any expression that returns 'true' or 'false'. When the condition is false, the while loop terminates and the program continues with the execution of the code following the loop. The while loop construction looks like this:\n\nThe following is a series of examples, the solution of which will help us better understand the use of the while loop.\nExample: Sequence of 2k+1 numbers\nWrite a program that prints all numbers ≤ n from the sequence: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …, having in mind that each next number = previous number * 2 + 1.\nHere is how we can solve the task:\n\nWe create a variable num for the current number to which we assign an initial value of 1.\nWe put the current number  as the loop condition.\nIn the body of the loop, we print the value of the current number and increase the current number, using the formula from the problem.\n\nHere is a sample representation of the described steps:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#4.\nExample: Numbers in range [1 … 100]\nEnter an integer in the range [1 … 100]. If it is invalid, input an integer again. In this case, we will consider any number that is not in the specified range as invalid.\nWe can solve the task through the following algorithm:\n\nWe create a variable num, to which we assign the integer value obtained from the console input.\nFor a loop condition, we put an expression, that is true, if the number of the input is not in the range specified in the task condition.\nIn the body of the loop: we print a message \"Invalid number!\" on the console, and then we assign a new value to num from the console input.\nHaving validated the input number, we print its value outside the body of the loop.\n\nHere is a sample representation of the algorithm, using a while loop:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#5.\nGreatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nBefore proceeding to the next task, it is necessary to get acquainted with the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD).\nDefinition of GCD: the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers a and b is the largest number that divides simultaneously both a and b without a remainder. For example:\n\n\n\na\nb\nGCD\n\n\n\n\n24\n16\n8\n\n\n67\n18\n1\n\n\n12\n24\n12\n\n\n15\n9\n3\n\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n\n100\n88\n4\n\n\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm\nIn the next task, we will use the Euclidean algorithm, one of the first published algorithms for finding the GCD:\nUntil we reach a remainder of 0:\n\nWe divide the larger number by the smaller one.\nWe take the remainder of the division.\n\nPseudocode for the Euclidean algorithm:\nwhile b ≠ 0\n  var oldB = b;\n  b = a % b;\n  a = oldB;\nprint а;\n\nExample: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nEnter integers a and b and find GCD(a, b).\nWe will solve the task using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nWe create a and b variables, to which we assign the integer values obtained from the console input.\nFor a loop condition, we put an expression that is true if the b number is different than 0.\nIn the body of the loop: we follow the conditions of the pseudocode: \nWe create a temporary variable, to which we assign the current value of b.\nWe assign a new value to b, which is the remainder of the division of a and b.\nWe assign the previous value of the b variable to a.\n\n\nOnce the loop is complete and, we have found the GCD, we print it on the screen.\n\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#6.\nDo-while loop\nThe next type of loop we will get acquainted with is the do-while. It resembles the while loop by structure, but there is a significant difference between the two. It consists in the fact that do-while will execute its body at least once. Why is this happening? At do-while loop construction, the condition is always checked after its body, which ensures that the code will be executed after the first loop iteration, and the check for the loop termination will be applied to each subsequent iteration of the do-while. \n\nThe following is the usual series of sample problems, the solution of which will help us better understand the use of the do-while loop.\nExample: Calculating factorial\nCalculate n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * … * n, where n is a natural number. For example, if n = 5, the result will be: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\nHere is how we can calculate the factorial:\n\nWe create the variable n, to which we assign the integer value obtained from the console input.\nWe create another variable - fact, with the initial value of 1. We will use it to calculate and store the factorial.\nFor a loop condition, we will use n > 1, since each time we perform the calculations in the body of the loop, we will reduce the value of n by 1.\nIn the body of the loop: \nWe assign a new value to fact, which is the result of multiplying the current values of fact and n .\nWe decrease the value of n by -1.\n\n\nWe print the final value of the factorial outside the body of the loop.\n\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#7.\nExample: Sum of a number's digits\nSum the digits of a positive integer n. For example, if n = 5634, the result will be: 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 18.\nWe can use the following idea to solve the task:\n\nWe create the variable n to which we assign a value equal to the number entered by the user.\nWe create a second variable - sum, with the initial value of 0. We will use it to calculate and store the result.\nFor a loop condition, we will use n > 0, since we will remove the last digit of  n  after each calculation of the result in the body of the loop.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe assign a new value to sum, equals to the sum of the current value of sum and the last digit of n.\nWe assign a new value to n, which is the result of removing the last digit of  n.\n\n\nWe print the final value of the sum outside the body of the loop.\n\n\n\nn % 10: returns the last digit of the number n.\nn / 10: deletes the last digit of n.\n\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#8.\nInfinite loops and break operator\nSo far, we got acquainted with different types of loops and learned about their constructions and how they are applied. Now, we need to understand what an infinite loop is, when it occurs and how we can terminate its execution through the break operator.\nWhat is an Infinite loop?\nAn infinite loop is the one that repeats infinitely the execution of its body. An infinite loop is the one that repeats infinitely the execution of its body. For while and do-while loops the chaeck for the end of a loop is a conditional expression that always returns true. An infinite for occurs when there is no condition to end the loop. \nHere is what an infinite while loop looks like:\n\nAnd here is what an infinite for loop looks like:\n\nThe break operator\nWe already know that the infinite loop executes a specific code to infinity, but what if we want to forcibly exit the loop under a given condition at some point? In this situation, the break operator comes in handy.\n\nThe break operator stops the loop execution at the moment it is called and continues from the first line after the end of the loop. This means that the current iteration of the loop will not be completed and, accordingly the rest of the code in the body of the loop will not be executed. \n\n\nExample: Prime numbers\nThe next task we are going to solve requires to conduct a prime number check. Before proceeding with it, let’s remember what prime numbers are.\nDefinition: an integer is prime when it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1. By definition, prime numbers are positive and greater than 1. The smallest prime number is 2.\nWe can assume that an integer n is prime, if n > 1 and n is not divisible by any of the numbers between 2 and n-1.\nThe first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, …\nIn contrast, non-prime (composite) numbers are such numbers that are composed of the product of prime numbers.\nHere are a few examples of composite numbers:\n\n10 = 2 * 5\n42 = 2  3  7\n143 = 13 * 11\n\nVerification algorithm whether an integer is prime: we check if n > 1 and n are divisible by 2, 3, …, n-1 without remainder.\n\nIf it is divisible by any of the numbers, it is composite.\nIf it is not divisible by any of the numbers, then it is prime.\n\n\nWe can optimize the algorithm by checking the divisors to √n instead to n-1. Think about the reason why.\n\n\nExample: Prime number verification. The break operator\nCheck if a number n is prime. To do so, we will check if n is divisible by the numbers between 2 and √n. \nHere is the algorithm for prime number verification, described in steps:\n\nWe create the variable n, to which we assign the integer value obtained from the console input.\nWe create a boolean variable - isPrime with an initial value true if the number is equal or greater than two (since by definition, numbers such as 0, 1, -1, and -2 are non-prime).  We assume that a number is prime until proven otherwise.\nWe create a for loop, and we assign 2 as an initial value of the loop variable and its current value  as a condition. The step of the loop is 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we check if n divided by the current value has a remainder. If there is no remainder, we change the value of isPrime to false and forcibly terminate the loop with a break operator.\nDepending on the isPrime value, we print whether the number is prime (true) or composite (false).\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the described algorithm:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#9.\nExample: Break operator in an infinite loop\nWrite a program that checks if a number n is even – if it is, prints it on the screen. An even number is each number that is divisible by 2 without a remainder. In the case of an invalid number, it should be re-input, and a message stating that the number is not even should be displayed. \nHere is an idea how to solve the task:\n\nWe create a variable n, to which we assign an initial value of 0.\nWe create an infinite while loop, and put true as a condition.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe take the intiger obtained by the console input and assign it to n.\nIf the number is even, we exit the loop with a break. \nOtherwise, we display a message stating that the number is not even. The iterations continue until an even number is entered.\n\n\nWe print the even number on the screen.\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the idea:\n\nNote: although the code above is correct, it will not work if the user enters text instead of numbers, for example, \" Invalid number \". Then the parsing of the input text to a number will break, and the program will display error message (exception). Later in this chapter, we will learn how to deal with this problem and how to catch and handle exceptions using the try-catch construct.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#10.\nNested loops and the break operator\nHaving learned what nested loops are and how the break operator performs, it is time to understand how they both work together. For a better understanding, let’s write a step-by-step program that should make all possible combinations of pairs of numbers. The first number of the combination is increasing from 1 to 3, and the second one is decreasing from 3 to 1. The task must continue running until i + j is not equal to 2 (i.e., i = 1 and j = 1).\nThe desired result is:\n\nHere is one wrong solution, which seems correct at first glance:\n\nIf we leave our program this way, the result will be the following:\n\nWhy does this happen? As we can see, the result  is missing '1 1' . When the program reaches the point that  i 1  and j 1 , it enters the  if  check and performs the break  operation. Thus, we exit the inner loop, but then the execution of the outer loop continues. 'i' increases, the program enters the inner loop and prints the result.\n\nWhen we use the break operator in a nested loop, it interrupts the execution of the inner loop only.\n\n\nWhat is the correct solution? One way of solving this task is by declaring a bool variable, which keeps track of whether the loop should continue. In case of need to exit (from all nested loops), the variable is set to 'true' and exits the internal cycle with a 'break', and at the next check, will exit from the outer loop. Here is a sample implementation of this idea:\n\nThus, when i + j = 2, the program will set the hasToEnd = true and exit the inner loop. Upon the next iteration of the outer loop due to the if check, the program will not reach the inner loop and interrupt its execution. \nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#11.\nError handling: try-catch construction\nThe last thing we will get familiar with within this chapter is how to \"catch\" errors with the try-catch construction.\nWhat is try-catch?\nThe try-catch program construction is used to intercept and handle exceptions (errors) during the program execution.\nIn programming, exceptions are notifications of an event that disrupts the normal operation of a program. Such exceptional events interrupt the execution of our program, and it is looking for something to handle the situation. If it does not find it, the exception is printed on the console (the program \"fails\"). If it finds, the exception is processed and the program continues its normal execution without \"failing\". In a bit, we will see how this happens.\nWhen an exception occurs, the exception is said to have been ”thrown” (throw exception). Hence the expression ”catch exception”.\nThe try-catch construction\nThe try-catch construction has different types, but for now, we will get acquainted only with the most basic of them, where the catch block will intercept any error in a variable named ex\n \nIn the next task, we will see how to handle a situation where the user enters an input other than a number (for example, string instead of int) using  try-catch .\nExample: Handling invalid numbers with try-catch\nWrite a program that checks if a number n is even – if it is, print in on the screen. Upon entering an invalid number, a message appears stating that the input data is not a valid number, and another input data must be made.\nHere is how we can solve the problem:\n\nWe create an infinite while loop, for which we set true as a condition.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe create a try-catch construction.\nIn the try block, we write the programming logic for reading the user input, parsing it to a number, and then check for an even number.\nIf the number is even, we print it and exit the loop (with break). The program is done, and it ends.\nIf the number is odd, we print a message that an even number is required, without exiting the loop (since we want to repeat the step with entering input data).\nIf we catch an exception upon executing the try block, we write a message for an invalid input number, and the loop is repeated because we do not explicitly exit it.\n\n\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the described idea:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#12.\nNow the solution should always work whether we enter integers, invalid numbers (for example, too many digits), or texts that do not contain numbers.\nTasks with loops\nIn this chapter, we have introduced several new types of loops that we can use to make repetitions with more complex program logic. Let's solve several tasks using the new knowledge.\nTask: Fibonacci numbers\nIn mathematics, Fibonacci numbers form a series that looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …\nThe formula to form the sequence is:\nF0 = 1\nF1 = 1\nFn = Fn-1 + Fn-2\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput (n)\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n10\n89\nF(11) = F(9) + F(8)\n\n\n5\n8\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3)\n\n\n20\n10946\nF(20) = F(19) + F(18)\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n1\n1\n\n\n\nWrite a program in which we enter an integer number n and calculate the n-number of Fibonacci.\nHints and guidelines\nAn idea to solve the task:\n\nWe create a n variable, to which we assign the integer value obtained from the console input.\nWe create f0 и f1 variables to which we assign value 1 since this is how the sequence begins.\nWe create a for loop with a condition current value i .\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe create a temporary variable fNext to which we assign the next number of the Fibonacci sequence.\nWe assign the current value of f1 to f0.\nWe assign the value of the temporary variable fNext to f1.\n\n\nWe print the n-number of Fibonacci outside the loop.\n\nSample implementation:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#13.\nTask: Numbers pyramid\nPrint the numbers 1… n in a pyramid as in the examples below. On the first line, we print one number on the second line, we print two numbers, on the third line, we print three numbers, etc., until the numbers run out. On the last line, we print as many numbers as we have left until we get to n.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n12 34 5 67\n5\n12 34 5\n10\n12 34 5 67 8 9 10\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe can solve the task with two nested loops (by rows and columns) by printing in them and leaving when reaching the last number. Here is the idea, described in more detail:\n\nWe create a n variable, to which we assign the integer value obtained from the console input.\nWe create a num variable with an initial value of 1. It will keep the number of printed numbers. At each iteration, we will increase it by 1 and print it.\nWe create an outer for loop, which will be responsible for the rows in the table. We name the loop variable as row and assign it an initial value 0. We set row  as a condition. The size of the step is 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we create an inner for loop, which will be responsible for the columns in the table. We name the loop variable as col and assign it an initial value 0. We set col  (row = number of digits per line) as a condition. The size of the step is 1.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe check if col > 1 and if yes – we print space. If we don't perform this check and directly print space, we will have an unnecessary one at the beginning of each line.\nWe print the number num in the current cell of the table and increase it with 1.\nWe perform a check for num > n. If num is greater than n, we break the inner loop.\n\n\nWe print a blank line to proceed to the next one.\nWe check again if num > n. If it's greater, we interrupt the execution of our program with a break.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#14.\nTask: Numbers table\nPrint the numbers 1 … n in a table as per the examples below.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 2 32 3 23 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 42 3 4 33 4 3 24 3 2 1\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe can solve the task with two nested loops and a little bit of calculations inside:\n\nWe read from the console the table size in an integer variable n.\nWe create a for loop, which is responsible for the table rows. We name the loop variable as row and assign it an initial value 0. We set row  as a condition. The size of the step is 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we create a nested for loop, which is responsible for the table columns. We name the loop variable as col and assign it an initial value 0. We set col  as a condition. The size of the step is 1.\nIn the body of the nested loop:\nWe create a num variable, to which we assign the result of current row + current column + 1 (+1, since we start counting from 0).\nWe perform a check if num > n. If num is greater than n, we assign a new value of two times n - current value of num to num. We do this to not exceed n in any of the table cells.\nWe print the number from the current table cell.\n\n\n\n\nWe print a blank line in the outer loop to proceed to the next one.\n\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/659#15.\nWhat did we learn in this chapter?\nWe can use the for loops with a step:\nfor (int i = 1; i \nThe while / do-while loops are repeated as long as a given condition is true:\nint num = 1;\nwhile (num \nIf we need to interrupt the loop execution, we use the break operator:\nint n = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n   n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\n   if (n % 2 == 0)  {\n      break; // even number -> exit from the loop\n   }\n   System.out.println(\"The number is not even.\");\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Even number entered: {0}\", n);\n\nWe already know how to catch errors during the execution of our program:\ntry {\n    System.out.println(\"Enter even number: \");\n    int n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\n} catch (Exception ex) {\n    System.out.println(\"Invalid number.\");\n}\n// If Integer.parseInt(…) fails, the catch { … } block will be executed\n\n"},"chapter-07-complex-loops-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-07-complex-loops-exam-problems.html","title":"7.2.

After that, we initialize 6 variables - one for each of the six digits of the numbers we have to output as a result.\n\nAfter that, we start constructing the while loops.\n\nWe initialize the first digit: d1 = 0.\nWe set a condition for each loop: the digit has to be lower than or equal to 9.\nAt the start of each loop, we set the value of the next digit, in this case: d2 = 0. In the nested for loops, we initialize the variables in the inner loops with each incrementation of the outer loops. We want to achieve the same behavior here as well.\nAt the end of each loop, we increase the digit by one: d++.\nIn the innermost loop we do the check and, if necessary, print on the console.\n\n\nLet's remove the if check from the innermost loop. Now, let's initialize each variable outside the loops and delete the lines dx = 0. After we start the program, we get only 10 results. Why? And what if we use a do-while loop? In our case this loop doesn't seem suitable, does it? Think about why. Of course, you can also solve the problem by using an endless loop.\n\nAs we can see, we can solve the same problem by using different types of loops. Of course, there is a most suitable choice for each problem. To practice each type of loop, try to solve each of the following problems by using every type of loop we've learned so far.\nTest in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/660#1.\nProblem: Stop Number\nWrite a program that prints on the console all numbers from N to M that are divisible by 2 and 3 without remainder, in reversed order.

There's a little catch here - the problem requires us to print the numbers in reversed order. This means that the initial value of the variable i will be the greater number, and from the examples, we can see that this is M. Thus, the final value of i should be N. The fact that we will print the results in reversed order and the values of i suggest that the step will decrease i by 1.\n\nAfter we have initialized the for loop, it is time for the third part of the problem - to check the condition if the given number is divisible by both 2 and 3 without remainder. We will do this by using one simple if condition, that we will let the reader construct.\nThe other tricky part in this problem is that, apart from the check above, we need an additional one - if the number is equal to the \"stop\" number entered from the console on the third line. To reach this check, the number we're checking has to pass the check above. That's why we add one more if statement nested in the previous one. If the condition is true, we have to stop printing. We can achieve this with the break operator which will lead us out of the for loop.\nAccordingly, if the condition that checks whether the number is equal to the \"stop\" number returns false, our program should continue printing. This covers the fourth and last part of our program.\nTest in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/660#2.\nProblem: Special Numbers\nWrite a program that reads an integer N and generates all possible \"special\" numbers from 1111 to 9999.

Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Triangle Area in the plane\n\n   \n      \n        A triangle in the plane is defined by the coordinates of its three vertices. First, the vertex (x1, y1) is set. Then the other two vertices are set: (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), which lie on a common horizontal line (i.e. they have the same Y coordinates). Write a program that calculates the area of the triangle by the coordinates of its three vertices.\n      \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nInput\nThe console provides 6 integers (one per line):\nx1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3.\n\nAll input numbers are in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nIt is guaranteed that y2 = y3.\n\nOutput\nPrint on the console the area of the triangle.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\nComments\n\n\n\n\n5-26111\n7.5\n\nThe side of the triangle а = 6 - 1 = 5The height of the triangle h = 1 - (-2) = 3The area of the triangle S = a * h / 2 = 5 * 3 / 2 = 7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\nComments\n\n\n\n\n41-1-33-3\n8\n\nThe side of the triangle а = 3 - (-1) = 4The height of the triangle h = 1 - (-3) = 4The area of the triangle S = a * h / 2 = 4 * 4 / 2 = 8\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIt is very important when facing such types of tasks where some coordinates are given to pay attention to the order in which they are submitted and to properly understand which of the coordinates we will use and how. In this case, the input is in order x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3. If we do not follow this sequence, the solution becomes incorrect. First, we write the code that reads the input data:\n\nWe have to calculate the side and the height of the triangle. From the pictures, as well as the condition y2 = y3, we notice that the one side is always parallel to the horizontal axis. This means that its length is equal to the length of the segment between its coordinates x2 and x3, which is equal to the difference between the larger and the smaller coordinates. Analogically, we can calculate the height. It will always be equal to the difference between y1 and y2 (or y3, as they are equal). Since we do not know if x2 is greater than x3, or y1 will be below or above the triangle side, we will use the absolute values of the difference to always get positive numbers because one segment cannot have a negative length.\n\nwe will calculate it using our familiar formula for finding an area of a triangle. An important thing to consider is that although we get only integers at an input, the area will not always be an integer. That's why we use a variable of double type for the area. We have to convert the right side of the equation because if we give whole numbers as equation parameters, our result will also be an integer.\n\nThe only thing left is to print the area on the console.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#0.\nProblem: Moving Bricks\nConstruction workers have to transfer a total of x bricks. Workers are w in numbers and work simultaneously. They transport the bricks in trolleys, each with a capacity of m bricks. Write a program that reads the integers x, w, and m, and calculates what is the minimum number of courses the workers need to do to transport the bricks.\nInput\nOn the console 3 integers are given, one per line:\n\nThe number of bricks x is read from the first line.\nThe number of workers w is read from the second line.\nThe capacity of the trolley m is read from the third line.\n\nAll input numbers are integers in the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput\nPrint on the console the minimum number of courses needed to transport the bricks.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n120230\n2\nWe have 2 workers, each transporting 30 bricks per course.

In total, workers are transporting 30 bricks per course. To transport 355 bricks, exactly 12 courses are needed: 11 complete courses carry 330 bricks and the last twelfth course carries the last 25 bricks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n51230\n1\nWe have 5 workers, each transporting 30 bricks per course. In total, workers are transporting 150 bricks per course. To transport 5 bricks, only 1 course is sufficient (although incomplete, with only 5 bricks).\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe input is standard, and we only need to be careful about the sequence in which we read the data.\n\nWe calculate how many bricks the workers transport in a single course.\n\nBy dividing the total number of bricks transported for 1 course, we will obtain the number of courses required to carry them. We have to consider that when dividing whole numbers, the remainder is ignored and always rounded down. To avoid this, we will convert the right side of the equation to double and use the Math.Ceiling(…) function to round the result always up. When the bricks can be transferred with an exact number of courses, the division will return a whole number and there will be nothing to round. Accordingly, if not, the result of the division will be the number of exact courses but a decimal fraction. The decimal part will be rounded up and we will get the required 1 course for the remaining bricks.\n\nFinally, we print the result on the console.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#1.\nSimple Conditions – Problems\nThe second problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam covers conditional statements and simple calculations. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Point on a Segment\nA horizontal segment is placed on a horizontal line, set with the x coordinates of both ends: first and second. A point is located on the same horizontal line and is set with its x coordinate. Write a program that checks whether the point is inside or outside the segment and calculates the distance to the nearest end of the segment.\nInput\nThe console reads 3 integer numbers (one per line):\n\nOn the first line, the number \"first\" is read – one end of the segment.\nOn the second line, the number \"second\" is read – the other end of the segment.\nOn the third line, the number \"point\" is read – the location of the point.\n\nAll input numbers are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nOutput\nPrint the result on the console:\n\nOn the first line, print \"in\" or \"out\" – whether the point is inside or outside the segment.\nOn the second line, print the distance from the point to the nearest end of the segment.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n1057\nin2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n8105\nout3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n1-23\nout2\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input from the console.\n\nSince we do not know which point is on the left and which is on the right, we will create two variables to mark this. Since the left point is always the one with the smaller x coordinate, we will use Math.Min(…) to find it.  Accordingly, the right one is always the one with a larger x coordinate and we will use Math.Max(…). We will also find the distance from point x to the two points. Because we do not know their position relative to each other, we will use Math.Abs(…) to get a positive result.\n\n\nThe shorter of the two distances we can found using Math.Min(…).\n\nWhat remains is to find whether the point is on or out of the line. The point will be on the line whenever it matches one of the other two points or its x coordinate lies between them. Otherwise, the point is outside the line. After checking, we display one of the two messages, depending on which condition is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we print the distance previously found.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#2.\nProblem: Point in a Figure\nWrite a program that checks whether a point (with coordinates x and y) is inside or outside the following figure:\n\nInput\nThe console reads two integers (one per line): x and y.\nAll input numbers are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nOutput\nPrint on the console \"in\" or \"out\" – whether the point is inside or outside the figure (the outline counts as inside).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n8-5\nin\n6-3\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11-5\nout\n112\nout\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo find whether our point is in the figure, we will divide the figure into 2 rectangles:\n\n\nA sufficient condition is a point to be located in one of them, to be in the figure.\nWe read the input data from the console:\n\nWe will initialize two variables that will mark whether the point is in one of the rectangles. When printing the message, we will check whether any of the variables has accepted a value of true. It is enough only one of them to be true so that the point is in the figure.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#3.\nComplex Conditions – Problems\nThe third problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam includes several nested checks combined with simple calculations. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Date After 5 days\nThere are two numbers given - d (day) and m (month) that form a date. Write a program that prints the date that will be 5 days a particular date. For example, 5 days after 28.03 is the date 2.04. e assume that the months: April, June, September, and November have 30 days, February has 28 days, and the rest have 31 days. Months to be printed with leading zero when they contain a single digit (e.g. 01, 08).\nInput\nThe input is read from the console and consists of two lines:\n\nOn the first line, we read an integer d in the range [1 … 31] – day. The number of the day does not exceed the number of days in that month (e.g. 28 for February).\nOn the second line, we read an integer m in the range [1 … 12] – month. Month 1 is January, month 2 is February,  …, month 12 is December. The month may contain a leading zero (e.g. April may be written as 4 or 04).\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing the date after 5 days in the format day.month on the console. The month must be a 2-digit number with a leading zero, if necessary. The day must be written without leading zero.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2803\n2.04\n2712\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n251\n30.01\n2602\n3.03\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe take the input from the console.\n\nTo make our checks easier, we'll create a variable that will contain the number of days that we have in the month we set.\n\nWe increase the day by 5.\n\nWe check if the day has not exceeded the number of days in the month. If so, we must deduct the days of the month from the obtained day to calculate which day of the next month our day corresponds to.\n\nAfter we have passed to the next month, this should be noted by increasing the initial one by 1. We need to check if it has not become greater than 12 and if it has, to adjust it. Because we cannot skip more than one month when we increase by 5 days, the following check is enough.\n\nThe only thing that remains is to print the result on the console. It is important to format the output correctly to display the leading zero in the first 9 months. This is done by adding a formatting string** %02d at the second element. 0 shows what number must be used in that place, and 2 shows the number of digits that must be filled with the corresponding number.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#4.\nProblem: Sums of 3 Numbers\nThere are 3 integers given.  Write a program that checks if the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one. For example, if the numbers are 3, 5, and 2, the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one: 2 + 3 = 5.\nInput\nThe console reads three integers, one per line. The numbers are in the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput\n\nPrint a text line on the console containing the solution of the problem in the format \"a + b = c\", where a, b and c are among the three input numbers and a ≤ b.\nIf the problem has no solution, print \"No\" on the console.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n352\n2 + 3 = 5\n224\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n115\nNo\n263\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe take the input from the console.\n\nWe have to check if the sum of a pair of numbers is equal to the third number. We have three possible cases:\n\na + b = c\na + c = b \nb + c = a\n\nWe will write a template, which will later be complemented by the required code. If none of the above three conditions is met, we will make our program print \"No\".\n\nWe now have to understand the order in which the two addends will be written in the output of the program. For this purpose, we will create a nested condition that checks which one of the two numbers is the larger one. In the first case, it will look like this:\n\nSimilarly, we will supplement the other two cases. The full code of the program will look like this:\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#5.\nSimple Loops – Problems\nThe fourth problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam includes a single loop with simple logic in it. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Sums with Step of 3\nWe are given n integers: a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the sums:\n\nsum1 = a1 + a4 + a7 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the first one with step of 3).\nsum2 = a2 + a5 + a8 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the second one with step of 3).\nsum3 = a3 + a6 + a9 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the third one with step of 3).\n\nInput\nThe input data is read from the console. The first line holds an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000). On the next n lines, we are given n integers in the range [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.\nOutput\nOn the console, we should print 3 lines containing the 3 sums in a format such as in the example.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n235\nsum1 = 3sum2 = 5sum3 = 0\n47-2612\nsum1 = 19sum2 = -2sum3 = 6\n535278\nsum1 = 10sum2 = 13sum3 = 2\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will take the count of numbers from the console and declare starting values of the three sums.\n\nSince we do not know in advance how many numbers we will process, we will take them one at a time in a loop which will be repeated n times and we will process them in the body of the loop.\n\nTo find out in which of the three sums we need to add the number, we will divide its sequence number into three and we will use the remainder. We will use the variable i, which tracks the number of runs of the loop, to find out which sequence number we are at. When the remainder of i/3 is zero, it means we will add this number to the first sum, when it is 1 to the second one, and when it is 2 to the third one.\n\nFinally, we will print the result on the console in the required format.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#6.\nProblem: Sequence of Increasing Elements\nA series of n numbers is given: a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the length of the longest increasing sequence of consecutive elements in the series of numbers.\nInput\nThe input data is read from the console. The first line holds an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000). On the following n lines, we are given n integers in the range [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.\nOutput\nOn the console, we must print one number – the length of the longest increasing sequence.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3524\n2\n42876\n2\n41244\n3\n45678\n4\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve this problem, we need to think in a bit more algorithmic way.  A sequence of numbers is given to us, and we need to check whether each subsequent one will be larger than the previous one and if so, we count how long is the sequence in which this condition is fulfilled. Then we have to find which sequence of these is the longest one. To do this, let's create some variables that we will use during solving the problem.\n\nThe variable n is the count of numbers we get from the console. In countCurrentLongest we will keep the number of elements in the increasing sequence we are currently counting. For example, in the sequence: 5, 6, 1, 2, 3 countCurrentLongest will be 2 when we reach the second element of the counting (5, 6, 1, 2, 3) and will become 3 when we reach the last element (5, 6, 1, 2, 3), because the increasing row 1, 2, 3 has 3 elements. We will use countLongest to keep the longest increasing sequence. The other variables are a – the number we are currently in, and aPrev – the previous number which we will compare with a to see if the row is growing.\nWe begin to run the numbers and check if the present number a is larger than the previous aPrev one. If this is true, then the row is growing, and we need to increase its number by 1. This is stored in the variable that tracks the length of the sequence we are currently in – countCurrentLongest. If the number a is not greater than the previous one, it means that a new sequence starts, and we have to start the count from 1. Finally, after all the checks are done, aPrev becomes the number we are currently using, and we start the loop from the beginning with the next entered a.\nHere is a sample implementation of the algorithm described:\n\nWhat remains is to see which of all sequences is the longest one. We will do this by checking in the loop if the sequence we are currently in has become longer than the longest one by now. The whole loop will look like this:\n\nFinally, we print the length of the longest sequence found.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#7.\nDrawing Figures in the console – Problems\nThe fifth problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam requires using one or several nested loops for drawing a figure on the console. Logical deductions, simple calculations, and checks might be required. The problem checks the students' abilities to think logically and come up with simple algorithms for solving problems, i.e. to think algorithmically. Here are a few examples for an exam problem:\nProblem: Perfect Diamond\nWrite a program that reads an integer n from the console and draws a perfect diamond with size n as in the examples below.\nInput\nThe input is an integer n within the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput\nThe diamond should be printed on the console as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n * *-* * \n3\n  *   *-* *-*-* *-*   *  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n   *     *-*   *-*-* *-*-*-* *-*-*   *-*     *   \n5\n    *       *-*     *-*-*   *-*-*-* *-*-*-*-* *-*-*-*   *-*-*     *-*       *    \n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the given input results we can see that we are required to print repeating symbols. That's why in advance we type a method that we will use to repeat the same symbol that times as we need it.\n\nIn tasks for drawing figures, the most important thing to consider is the sequence in which we will draw. Which items are repeated and with what steps?  We can see that the top and bottom parts of the diamond are the same. The easiest way to solve the problem is by creating a loop that draws the upper part, and then another loop that draws the bottom part (opposite to the top one).\nWe will read the number n from the console.\n\nWe start painting the top half of the diamond. We see that each row starts with a few empty spaces and *. If we take a closer look, we will notice that the empty spaces are always equal to n – the number of lines (the first row is n-1, the second – n-2, etc.). We will start by drawing the number of empty spaces, and the first asterisk. Let's not forget to use System.out.print(…) instead of System.out.println(…), to stay on the same line. At the end of the line, we write System.out.println(…), to go to a new line. Notice that we start counting from 1, not from 0. Next, we will only add a few times -* to finish the line.\nHere is part of the code for the top of the diamond:\n\nWhat remains is to complete each line with the required number of -* elements. On each row, we have to add i-1 such items (on the first 1-1 -> 0, the second -> 1, etc.)\nHere is the complete code for drawing the top of the diamond:\n\nTo draw the bottom part of the diamond, we have to reverse the upper part. We will count from n-1, because if we start from n, we will draw the middle row twice. Do not forget to change the step from ++ to --.\nHere is the complete code for drawing the top of the diamond:\n\nWhat remains is to assemble the whole program by first reading the input, printing the top part of the diamond, and then the bottom part of the diamond.\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#8.\nProblem: Rectangle with Stars in the Center\nWrite a program that reads from the console an integer n and draws a rectangle with size n with two asterisks in its center as in the examples below.\nInput\nThe input is an integer n in the range [2 … 1000].\nOutput\nThe rectangle should be printed on the console as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n%%%%%**%%%%%\n3\n%%%%%%%    %% ** %%    %%%%%%%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n%%%%%%%%%      %%  **  %%      %%%%%%%%%\n5\n%%%%%%%%%%%        %%        %%   **   %%        %%        %%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWith this problem, we also notice that we will have to type the same symbol several times. To make things easier we type a method, with which we will type the same symbol fast and easily.\n\nWe read the input data.\n\nThe first thing we can easily notice is that the first and last rows contain 2 * n symbols %. We will start with this and then draw the middle part of the rectangle.\n\nFrom the examples, we see that the middle part of the figure always has an odd number of rows. Note that when an even number is set, the number of rows is equal to the previous odd number (2 -> 1, 4 -> 3, etc.). We create a variable that represents the number of rows that our rectangle will have, and correct it if the number n is even. Then we will draw a rectangle without the asterisks. Each row has for the beginning and the end the symbol % and between them 2 * n - 2 empty spaces (the width is 2 * n and we subtract 2 for the two percent at the end). Do not forget to move the code for the last line after the loop.\n\nWe can start and test the code so far. Everything without the two asterisks in the middle should work correctly.\nNow, in the body of the loop let's add the asterisks. We'll check if we're on the middle row. If we are in the middle, we will draw the row together with the asterisks, if not – we will draw a normal row. The line with the asterisks has n-2 empty spaces (n is half the length and we remove the asterisk and the percentage), two stars, and again n-2 empty spaces. We leave out of the check the two percent at the beginning and the end of the row.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#9.\nNested Loops with more complex logic – Problems\nThe last (sixth) problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam requires using of several nested loops and more complex logic inside them. The problems examine participants' ability to think algorithmically and to solve non-trivial coding problems that require nested loops with more complex logic and calculations. Here are a few examples of exam problems.\nProblem: Increasing 4 Numbers\nFor given pair of numbers a and b generate all four number n1, n2, n3, n4, for which a ≤ n1 .\nInput\nThe input contains two integers a and b in the range  [0 … 1000], one per line.\nOutput\nThe output contains all numbers in batches of four, in ascending order, one per line.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n37\n3 4 5 63 4 5 73 4 6 73 5 6 74 5 6 7\n1520\n15 16 17 1815 16 17 1915 16 17 2015 16 18 1915 16 18 2015 16 19 2015 17 18 1915 17 18 2015 17 19 2015 18 19 2016 17 18 1916 17 18 2016 17 19 2016 18 19 2017 18 19 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n57\nNo\n1013\n10 11 12 13\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will read the input data from the console. We also create the additional variable count, which will keep track of existing number ranges.\n\nIt will be easier to solve the problem if we logically divide it into parts. If we are required to draw all the rows from a number between a and b, we will do it using one loop that takes all the numbers from a to b. Let's think about how to do this with series of two numbers. The answer is easy – we will use nested loops. \n\nWe can test the incomplete program to see if it's accurate so far. It must print all pairs of numbers i, j for which i ≤ j.\nSince each next number of the row must be greater than the previous one, the second loop will run around i + 1 (the next greater number). Accordingly, if there is no sequence of two incremental numbers (a and b are equal), the second loop will not be fulfilled, and nothing will be printed on the console.\nSimilarly, what remains is to implement the nested loops for four numbers. We will add an increase of the counter that we initialized to know if there is such a sequence.\n\nFinally, we will check if the counter is equal to 0 and we will print \"No\" on the console accordingly, if so.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#10.\nProblem: Generating Rectangles\nBy a given number n and a minimum area m, generate all possible rectangles with integer coordinates in the range [-n…n] with an area of at least m. The generated rectangles must be printed in the following format:\n(left, top) (right, bottom) -> area\nRectangles are defined using the top left and bottom right corners. The following inequalities are in effect:\n\n-n ≤ left \n-n ≤ top \n\nInput\nTwo numbers, one per line, are entered from the console:\n\nAn integer n in the range [1 … 100] – sets the minimum and maximum coordinates of a peak.\nAn integer m in the range [0 … 50000] – sets the minimum area of the generated rectangles.\n\nOutput\n\nThe described rectangles should be printed on the console in a format such as in the examples below.\nIf there are no rectangles for the specified n and m, then print \"No\".\nThe order of rectangles in the output is not important.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12\n(-1, -1) (0, 1) -> 2(-1, -1) (1, 0) -> 2(-1, -1) (1, 1) -> 4(-1, 0) (1, 1) -> 2(0, -1) (1, 1) -> 2\n217\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n336\n(-3, -3) (3, 3) -> 36\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nRead the input data from the console. We will also create a counter, which will store the number of rectangles found.\n\nIt is very important to be able to imagine the problem before we begin to solve it. In our case, it is required to search for rectangles in a coordinate system. The thing we know is that the left point will always have the coordinate x, smaller than the right one. Accordingly, the upper one will always have a smaller y coordinate than the lower one. To find all the rectangles, we'll have to create a loop similar to the previous problem, but this time, not every next loop will start from the next number because some of the coordinates can be equal (for example left and top).\n\nWith the variables left and right we will track the coordinates on the horizontal, and with top and bottom - on the vertical way. The important thing here is knowing the corresponding coordinates so we can correctly calculate the sides of the rectangle. Now we have to find the area of the rectangle and check if it is greater than or equal to m.  One side will be the difference between left and right and the other one – between top and bottom. Since the coordinates may be eventually interchanged, we will use absolute values. Again, we add the counter in the loop, counting only the rectangles we write. It is important to note that the writing order is left, top, right, bottom, as it is set in the problem's description.\n\nFinally, we print \"No\" if there are no such rectangles.\n\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/661#11.\n"},"chapter-08-exam-preparation-part-2.html":{"url":"chapter-08-exam-preparation-part-2.html","title":"8.2. Practical Exam Preparation – part II","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 8.2. Preparation for a practical exam – part II\nIn this chapter, we will look at a practical exam on basics of programming held at SoftUni on December 18, 2016. The tasks give a good idea of what we can expect at the entrance exam in programming at SoftUni. The exam covers the learning material studied from this book and the \"Programming Basics\" course at SoftUni.\nVideo\n\n  Watch a video tutorial on this chapter here: \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9OscwPmZQE.\n\n\nExam tasks\nTraditionally, the entrance exam in SoftUni consists of 6 practical programming tasks:\n\nSimple task (without checks).\nA task with a single condition.\nA task with more complex conditions.\nA task with a single loop.\nA task with nested loops (drawing a figure on the console).\nA task with nested loops and more complex logic.\n\nLet's look at a real exam topic, the tasks it contains, and their solutions.\nTask: Distance\nWrite a program that calculates what is the distance passed by a car (in kilometers), for whick we know the initial speed (km/h), the initial time frame in minutes, then the speed is increased by 10%, the second time frame, then the speed is decreased by 5%, and the time until the end of the trip. To calculate the distance, you need to convert the minutes into hours (e.g., 70 minutes = 1.1666 hours).\nInput data\nThe input is read from the console and consists of 4 lines:\n\nThe initial speed in km/h – an integer within the range [1 … 300].\nThe first time in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nThe second time in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nThe third time in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\n\nOutput data\nPrint a number on the console: kilometers passed, formatted up to the second character after decimal point.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n90607080\n330.90\nDistance with initial speed: 90 km/h * 1 hour (60 min) = 90 kmAfter speed increase: 90 + 10% = 99.00 km/h * 1.166 hours (70 min) = 115.50 kmAfter speed decrease: 99 - 5% = 94.05 km/h * 1.33 hours (80 min) = 125.40 kmTotal number of km passed: 330.9 km\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n14011275190\n917.12\nDistance with initial speed: 140 km/h * 1.86 hours (112 min) = 261.33 kmAfter speed increase: 140 + 10% = 154.00 km/h * 1.25 hours (75 min) = 192.5 kmAfter speed decrease: 154.00 - 5% = 146.29 km/h * 3.16 hours (190 min) = 463.28 kmTotal number of km passed: 917.1166 km\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nIt is possible that such a description may look misleading and incomplete at first glance, which adds to the complexity of a relatively easy task. Let's separate the task into a few sub-tasks and try to solve each task one by one, which will lead us to the final result:\n\nOur initial sub-task will be to read the input data entered by the user, and store them in appropriate variables.\nExecution of the main programming logic, which in our case is a batch of simple calculations of the data that we already have.\nCalculation and format the result.\n\nThe main part of the programming logic is to calculate what will be the distance passed after all changes in speed. As during execution of the program, part of the data that we have is modified, we could separate the program code into a few logically separated parts:\n\nCalculation of the distance passed with initial speed.\nChange of speed and calculation of the distance passed.\nLast change of speed and calculation.\nAddition of the above.\n\nFor reading data from the console, we use Scanner:\n\nBy the task condition input data is being entered on four separate rows, therefore, we should execute the previous code a total of four times. \n\nTo perform calculations, we choose to use a type double.\nYou can read more about the different data typesin Java programming language here: https://introprogramming.info/intro-java-book/read-online/glava2-primitivni-tipove-i-promenlivi/\nThis way, we successfully solved the first sub-task. The next step is to convert the input data into appropriate types to perform the needed calculations. We choose to use Integer or int type because the condition of the task says that the input data must be within a particular range, for which this data type is sufficient. We will do the conversion in the following way:\n\nInitially, we save a variable that we will use multiple times. This approach of centralization gives us flexibility and the opportunity to change the overall result of the program with minimal effort. In case, we need to change the value, we need to do it only in one place in the code, which saves us time and effort.\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding repetitive code (centralization of program logic) in the tasks that we examine in the present book may look unnecessary at first glance, but this approach is very important upon building large-scale applications in a real work environment, and practicing it in an initial stage of training will help you build a quality programming style.\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate the travel time (in hours) by dividing the time by 60 (minutes in an hour). The travel distance is calculated by multiplying the starting speed by the time passed (in hours). After that, we change the speed by increasing it by 10%, as per the task description. Calculating the percentage, as well as the following distances passed, is done in the following way:\n\nThe time interval (in hours) is calculated by dividing the provided time interval in minutes by the minutes in an hour (60).\nThe distance passed is calculated by multiplying the time interval (in hours) by the speed obtained after the increase.\nThe next step is to decrease the speed by 5%, as per the task description.\nWe calculate the remaining distance as described in the first two points.\n\n\nSo far, we solved two of the most important sub-tasks, namely the data input and their processing. What remains is to calculate the result. Since it is required to format it up to 2 characters after the decimal point, we can do it as follows:\n\nIf you have worked correctly and run the program with the input data from the task condition, you will see that it works correctly.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/662#0.\nTask: Changing tiles\nHaralambi has some savings that he wants to use to change the tiles on the bathroom floor. The floor is rectangular, and the tiles are triangular. Write a program that calculates if his savings will be sufficient. Read from the console the width and length of the floor, as well as one of the sides of the triangle with its height to it. We must calculate how many tiles are needed, to cover the floor. The number of tiles must be rounded up to the higher integer and 5 more tiles must be added as spare tiles. Also, read from the console – the price per tile and the amount paid for the work** of a workman.\nInput data\nThe following 7 lines are read from the console:\n\nThe savings\nThe width of the floor\nThe length of the floor\nThe side of the triangle\nThe height of the triangle\nThe price of a tile\nThe amount for the workman\n\nAll numbers are real numbers in the range [0.00 … 5000.00].\nOutput data\nThe following must be printed on the console as a single line:\n\nIf the money is sufficient:\n“{The remaining money} lv left.”\n\n\nIf the money IS NOT sufficient:\n“You'll need {Needed money} lv more.”\n\n\n\nThe result must be formatted up to the second character after the decimal point.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n50032.50.50.77.80100\n25.60 lv left.\nFloor area → 3 * 2.5 = 7.5Tile area → 0.5 * 0.7 / 2 = 0.175Needed tiles → 7.5 / 0.175 = 42.857… = 43 + 5 spare tiles = 48Total amount → 48 * 7.8 + 100 (workman) = 474.4474.4  → 25.60 lv left\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n10005.558.950.900.8513.99321\nYou'll need 1209.65 lv more.\nFloor area → 5.55 * 8.95 = 49.67249Tile area → 0.9 * 0.85 / 2 = 0.3825Needed tiles → 49.67249 / 0.3825 = 129.86… = 130 + 5 spare tiles = 135Total amount → 135 * 13.99 + 321 (workman) = 2209.652209.65 > 1000 → 1209.65 lv are insufficient\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe task requires our program to accept more input data and perform more calculations, even though that the solution is identical. Reading the input data is done in the familiar way. Note that the Input part of the condition states that all input data are real numbers, and for that reason we would use the decimal type.\nNow that we already have everything to execute the programming logic, we can move to the next part. How can we calculate what is the needed number of tiles that will be sufficient to cover the entire floor? The condition is that tiles have triangular shape, which can confuse, but practically, the task needs just basic calculations. We can calculate the common part of the floor by the formula for finding rectangle area, and the area of a single tile using the relevant formula for triangle area.\nTo calculate the number of tiles that are needed, we divide the floor area by the area of a single tile (we should not forget to add the 5 additional tiles, that were mentioned in the condition).\n\n\n\nPay attention that the condition state that we should round up the number of tiles, obtained upon the division, up to the higher number, and then we should add 5. Find more information about the system functionality that does that: Math.ceil(…).\n\n\n\n\nWe can find the result by calculating the total amount needed to cover the entire floor, by adding the tile price with the price for the workman, which we have from the input data. We can guess that the total costs for tiles can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the price per tile. Whether the amount that we have will be sufficient, we understand by comparing the savings (from the input data) and the total costs.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/662#1.\nTask: Flowers shop\nA flowers shop offers 3 types of flowers: chrysanthemums, roses and tulips.

We need to pay more attention to the moment of making changes in the final price, so that we can properly build the logic of our program. Again, the bold text gives us sufficient guidelines on how to proceed. To begin with, we will separate the already defined values into variables, as we did in the previous tasks:\n\nWe do the same for the rest of the defined values:\n\nOur next sub-task is to read correctly the input data from the console. We will do it in the familiar way, but this time we will combine two separate functions – one for reading a line from the console and another one for its conversion into a numeric data type:\n\nLet's think of the most appropriate way to structure our programming logic. It is clear from the condition that the path of the program is divided mainly into two parts: spring / summer and autumn / winter. We can do the separation by conditional construction, by storing variables in advance for the prices of the individual flowers and the final result.\n\nWhat remains is to perform a few checks regarding the discounts of the different types of flowers, depending on the season, and to modify the final result. \nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/662#2.\nTask: Grades\nWrite a program that calculates statistics for grades in an exam. At the beginning, the program reads the number of students who attended the exam and for each student – their grade. At the end, the program must print the percentage of students that have grades between 2.00 and 2.99, between 3.00 and 3.99, between 4.00 and 4.99, 5.00 or more, and the average grade of the exam.\nInput data\nRead from the console a sequence of numbers, each on a separate line:\n\nOn the first line – the number of students who attended the exam – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nFor each individual student on a separate line – the grade on the exam – a real number within the range [2.00 … 6.00].\n\nOutput data\nPrint on the console 5 lines that hold the following information:\n\n\"Top students: {percentage of students with grade of 5.00 or more}%\".\n\"Between 4.00 and 4.99: {between 4.00 and 4.99 included}%\".\n\"Between 3.00 and 3.99: {between 3.00 and 3.99 included}%\".\n\"Fail: {less than 3.00}%\".\n\"Average: {average grade}\".\n\nThe results must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n103.002.995.683.01446.004.502.445\nTop students: 30.00%Between 4.00 and 4.99: 30.00%Between 3.00 and 3.99: 20.00%Fail: 20.00%Average: 4.06\n5 or more: 3 students = 30% of 10Between 4.00 и 4.99 - 3 students = 30% of 10Between 3.00 и 3.99 - 2 students = 20% of 10Under 3 - 2 students = 20% of 10The average grade is: 3 + 2.99 + 5.68 + 3.01 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4.50 + 2.44 + 5 = 40.62 / 10 = 4.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n6234562.2\nTop students: 33.33%Between 4.00 and 4.99: 16.67%Between 3.00 and 3.99: 16.67%Fail: 33.33%Average: 3.70\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nFrom the condition, we see that first we will read the number of students, and then, their grades. For that reason, first we will read the number of students and save it in a variable of int type. To read and process the grades themselves, we will use a for loop. The value of the int variable will be the end value of the i variable from the loop. This way, at each iteration of the loop will read each one of the grades.  \n\nBefore executing the code of the for loop, we will create variables where we will store the number of students for each group: poor results (up to 2.99), results from 3 to 3.99, from 4 to 4.99, and grades above 5. We will also need one more variable, where we will store the sum of all grades, via which we will calculate the average grade of all students.\n\nWe run the loop, and inside it, we declare one more variable, in which we will store the currently entered grade. The variable will be double type, and upon each iteration, we will check what is its value. According to this value, we increase the number of students in the relevant group by 1, as we should not forget to increase the total amount of the grades, which we also track.\n\nWhat percentage is occupied by a group of students from the total number, we can calculate by multiplying the number of students from the respective group by 100, and then divide by the total number of students.\n\n\n\nPay close attention to the numeric data type that you work with upon doing these calculations.\n\n\n\n\nThe final result is formed in the well know fashion – up to the second character after the decimal point.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/662#3.\nTask: Christmas hat\nWrite a program that reads from the console an integer n and draws a Christmas hat with width of 4 * n + 1 columns and height of 2 * n + 5 rows, as in the examples below.\nInput data\nThe input is read from the console – an integer n within the range [3 … 100].\nOutput data\nPrint on the console a Christmas hat, exactly like in the examples.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n......./|\\..............\\|/..............***.............*-*-*...........*--*--*.........*---*---*.......*----*----*.....*-----*-----*...*------*------*.*-------*-------*******************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n............./|\\..........................\\|/..........................***.........................*-*-*.......................*--*--*.....................*---*---*...................*----*----*.................*-----*-----*...............*------*------*.............*-------*-------*...........*--------*--------*.........*---------*---------*.......*----------*----------*.....*-----------*-----------*...*------------*------------*.*-------------*-------------*******************************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************************\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nIn tasks requiring drawing on the console, most often the user inputs an integer that is related to the total size of the figure that we need to draw. As the task requirements mention how the total length and width of the figure are calculated, we can use them as starting points. In the examples it is clear that regardless of the input data, we always have first two rows that are almost identical.\n......./|\\..............\\|/.......\nWe also notice that the last three rows are always present, as two of them are completely the same.\n******************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************\nBy these observations we can come up with the formula for the height of the variable part of the Christmas hat. We use the formula specified in the task to calculate the total height, by subtracting the size of the unchangeable part. We get (2 * n + 5) – 5 or 2 * n.\nTo draw the dynamic or the variable part of the figure, we will use a loop. The size of the loop will be from 0 to the width that we have by requirements, namely 4 * n + 1. Since we will use this formula in a few places in the code, it is a good practice to declare it in a separate variable. efore running the loop, we should declare variables for the number of individual symbols that participate in the dynamic part: dots and dashes. By analyzing examples, we can also prepare formulas for the starting values of these variables. Initially, the dashes are 0, but it is clear that we can calculate the number of dots by subtracting 3 from the total width (the number of symbols that are building the top of the Christmas hat) and then dividing by 2, as the number of dots on both sides of the hat is the same.\n.......***.............*-*-*...........*--*--*.........*---*---*.......*----*----*.....*-----*-----*...*------*------*.*-------*-------*\nAll that remains is to execute the body of the loop, as after each drawing we decrease the number of dots by 1 and increase the number of dashes by 1. Let's not forget to draw one star between each of them.\nThe sequence of drawing in the body of the loop is the following:\n\nSymbol string of dots\nStar\nSymbol string of dashes\nStar\nSymbol string of dashes\nStar\nSymbol string of dots\n\nIn case we have worked correctly, we will obtain figures identical to those in the examples.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/662#4.\nTask: Letters combination\nWrite a program that prints on the console all combinations of 3 letters within a specified range by skipping the combinations containing a certain letter. Finally, print the number of printed combinations.\nInput data\nThe input is read from the console and contains exactly 3 lines:\n\nA small letter from the English alphabet for a beginning of the range – between 'a' and 'z'.\nA small letter from the English alphabet for the end of the range – between the first letter and 'z'.\nA small letter from the English alphabet – from 'a' to 'z' – as the combinations containing this letter are skipped.\n\nOutput data\nPrint on a single line all combinations, corresponding to the requirements, followed by their number, separated by a space.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\nacb\naaa aac aca acc caa cac cca ccc 8\nAll possible combinations with letters 'а', 'b' and 'c' are:aaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb cccThe combinations containing 'b' are not valid.8 valid combinations remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nfkh\nfff ffg ffi ffj ffk fgf fgg fgi fgj fgk fif fig fii fij fik fjf fjg fji fjj fjk fkf fkg fki fkj fkk gff gfg gfi gfj gfk ggf ggg ggi ggj ggk gif gig gii gij gik gjf gjg gji gjj gjk gkf gkg gki gkj gkk iff ifg ifi ifj ifk igf igg igi igj igk iif iig iii iij iik ijf ijg iji ijj ijk ikf ikg iki ikj ikk jff jfg jfi jfj jfk jgf jgg jgi jgj jgk jif jig jii jij jik jjf jjg jji jjj jjk jkf jkg jki jkj jkk kff kfg kfi kfj kfk kgf kgg kgi kgj kgk kif kig kii kij kik kjf kjg kji kjj kjk kkf kkg kki kkj kkk 125\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nacz\naaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb ccc 27\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nAccording to the condition, we have as input data 3 lines, each of which is represented by one character of the ASCII table (https://www.asciitable.com). We could use an already defined function in Java to read single symbol from the console and save it in a variable with type char: \n\nLet's think of how we can achieve the final result. The task condition is to print all characters from the starting to the end (by skipping a particular letter), what should we do? \nThe easiest and most efficient way is to use a loop, by passing through all characters and printing those that are different from the letter that we need to skip. One of the advantages of Java is that we have the opportunity to use a different data type for a loop variable:\n\nThe result of running the code is all letters from a to z included, printed on a single line and separated by spaces. Does this look like the end result of our task? We must find a way to print 3 characters, as required, instead of 1. The execution of the program is very similar to a gaming machine. We usually win there if we manage to arrange several identical symbols. Let's say that the machine has space for three characters. When we stop on a particular character on the first place, the other two places will continue rolling characters among all possible ones. In our case, all possible characters are the letters from the starting to the end one, entered by the user, and the solution of our program is identical to the way a gaming machine works.\nWe use a loop that runs through all characters from the starting to the end letter, included. On each iteration of the first loop, we run a second one with the same parameters (but only if the letter of the first loop is valid, i.e., does not match the one that we must exclude, by requirements). In each iteration of the second loop, we run one more with the same parameters and the same condition. This way, we have three nested loops, as we will print the characters in the body of the latter.\n\nLet's not forget that we also need to print the total number of valid combinations that we have found, and they must be printed on the same line, separated by a space.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/662#5.\n"},"chapter-09-problems-for-champions.html":{"url":"chapter-09-problems-for-champions.html","title":"9.1.

They aim to develop algorithmic skills and acquire programming techniques to solve tasks with higher complexity.\nMore complex problems on the studied material\nWe will solve several programming problems that cover the material studied in the book but are more difficult than the usual problems of the entrance exams at SoftUni. If you want to become a champion of the basics of programming, we recommend this training to solve such complex tasks to make it easy for you to take exams.\nTask: Crossing sequences\nWe have two sequences:\n\na sequence of Tribonacci (by analogy with the Fibonacci sequence), where each number is the sum of the previous three (with given three numbers)\na sequence generated by a numerical spiral defined by looping like a spiral (right, bottom, left, top, right, bottom, left, top, etc.) of a matrix of numbers starting from its center with a given starting number and incremental step, by storing the current numbers in the sequence each time we make a turn\n\nWrite a program that finds the first number that appears in both sequences defined as describe above.\nExample\nLet the Tribonacci sequence start with 1, 2 and 3. This means that the first sequence will contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, 423, 778, 1431, 2632, 4841, 8904, 16377, 30122, 55403, 101902, and so on.\nAt the same time, let the numbers in the spiral begin with 5, and the spiral increases by 2 at each step.\n\nThen the second sequence will contain the numbers 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 23, 29, 37, and so on. We see that 37 is the first number to be found inside the Tribonacci sequence and the spiral one, and that is the desired solution to the problem.\nInput data\nInput data should be read from the console.\n\nOn the first three lines of the input we will read three integers, representing the first three numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, positive non-zero numbers, sorted in ascending order.\nOn the following two lines of the input, we will read two integers representing the first number and the step for each matrix's cell for the spiral of numbers. The numbers representing the spiral are positive non-zero numbers.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. There is no need to check.\nOutput data\nThe result should be printed on the console.\nOn the single line of the output, we must print the smallest number that occurs in both sequences. If there is no number in the range [1 … 1 000 000], which can be found in both sequences, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nAll numbers in the input will be in the range [1 … 1 000 000].\nAllowed program time: 0.3 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12352\n37\n13259952\n13\n99999922\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11111\n1\n147233\n23\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe task seems quite complicated, so we will break it into simpler sub-tasks.\nProcessing the input\nThe first step in solving the problem is to read and process the input. Input data consists of 5 integers: 3 for the Tribonacci sequence and 2 for the numerical spiral.\n\nOnce we have the input data, we need to think about how we will generate the numbers in the two sequences.\nGenerating Tribonacci sequence\nFor the Tribonacci sequence, we will always summing up the previous three values and then move the values of those numbers (the three previous ones) to one position in the sequence, i.e., the value of the first one must accept the value of the second one, and so on. When we are ready with the number, we will store its value in an array. Since the problem description states that the numbers in the sequences do not exceed 1,000,000, we can stop generating this range at 1,000,000.\n\nGenerating numerical spiral\nWe need to think of a relation between numbers in the numerical spiral so we can easily generate every next number without having to look at matrices and loop through them. If we carefully look at the picture from the description, we will notice that every 2 \"turns\" in the spiral, the numbers we skip are increased by 1, i.e. from 5 to 7 and from 7 to 9, not a single number is skipped, but we directly add with the step of the sequence. From 9 to 13 and from 13 to 17 we skip a number, i.e. we add the step twice. From 17 to 23 and from 23 to 29 we skip two numbers, i.e. we add the step three times and so on.\nThus, we see that for the first two we have the last number + 1 * the step, the next two we add with the 2 * the step, and so on. \nEvery time we want to get to the next number of the spiral, we will have to make such calculations.\n\nWhat we have to take care of is for every two numbers, our multiplier (let's call it \"coefficient\") must increase by 1 (spiralStepMul++), which can be achieved with a simple check (spiralCount % 2 == 0). The whole code from the generation of the spiral in an array is given below.\n\nFinding common number for the sequences\nOnce we have generated the numbers in both sequences, we can combine them and build the final solution. How will it look? For each of the numbers in the first sequence (starting from the smaller one), we will check if it exists in the other one. The first number that meets this criterion will be the answer to the task.\nWe will do a linear search in the second array. We will leave, the more curious readers, to optimize it using the technique called binary search because the second array is generated in sorted form, i.e., it meets the requirement to apply this type of search. The code for finding our solution will look like this:\n\nThe previous solution to the problem uses arrays to store the values. Arrays are not needed to solve the problem. There is an alternative solution that generates the numbers and works directly with them instead of keeping them in an array. On every step, we can check whether the numbers in the two sequences match. If this is the case, we will print the number on the console and terminate the execution of our program. Otherwise, we will see the current number of which sequence is the smaller one, and we will generate the next one where we are \"lagging\". The idea is that we will generate numbers from the sequence that is \"behind\" until we skip the current number of the other sequence and then vice versa, and if we find a match in the meantime, we will terminate the execution.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/663#0.\nTask: Magic dates\nDate is given in a \"dd-mm-yyyy\" format, e.g. 17-04-2018. We calculate the weight of that date by taking all of its digits, multiplying each digit with the others after it, and finally summing up all the results obtained. In our case, we have 8 digits: 17032007, so the weight is 1*7 + 1*0 + 1*3 + 1*2 + 1*0 + 1*0 + 1*7 + 7*0 + 7*3 + 7*2 + 7*0 + 7*0 + 7*7 + 0*3 + 0*2 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*7 + 3*2 + 3*0 + 3*0 + 3*7 + 2*0 + 2*0 + 2*7 + 0*0 + 0*7 + 0*7 = 144.\nOur task is to write a program that finds all the magical dates between two specific years (inclusively) corresponding to the given weight. Dates must be printed in ascending order (by date) in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\". We will only use the valid dates in the traditional calendar (the leap years have 29 days in February).\nInput data\nInput data should be read from the console. It consists of 3 lines:\n\nThe first line contains an integer: start year.\nThe second line contains an integer: end year.\nThe third line contains an integer: the search weight for the dates.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described.

In this case, we have 3 integers that should be read from the console, as this is the only entry and processing of input for the task.\nHaving the start and end year, it is good to understand how we will go through each date, without being confused by how many days there are in the month and whether it is a leap year, and so on.\nLoop through dates\nFor looping through the dates, we will take advantage of the functionality that gives us the LocalDate class, in Java. We will define a start date variable that we can do using the constructor that accepts a year, month, and day. We know the year is the starting year we read from the console, and the month and the day must be January and 1st respectively. In Java, the \"constructor\" of LocalDate accepts as the first argument the year, as second argument the month, and as the third argument the day of the month:\n\nOnce we have the start date, we want to create a loop that runs until we exceed the final year (or until we pass December 31 in the final year if we compare the full dates), increasing each day by one day.\nTo increase by one day in each rotation, we will use a method of LocalDate – plusDays(…), which will add one day to the current date. The method will take care instead of us whether to skip the next month, how many days there is a month, and everything around the leap years.\n\nCaution: since the LocalDate.plusDays(…) method returns the \"new\" date, it is important to assign the result, not just to call the method!\nFinally, our loop may look like this:\n\nNote: we can achieve the same result with a for loop: the initialization of the date goes to the first part of for, the condition is preserved and the step is the increase by 1 day.\nCalculating date weight\nEach date consists of exactly 8 characters (digits) – 2 for the day (d1, d2), 2 for the month (d3, d4), and 4 for the year (d5 to d8). It means that we will always have the same calculation every time, and we can benefit from this to define the formula statically (i.e., not to use loops, referring to different numbers from the date, but write the whole formula). To be able to write it, we will need all digits from the date in individual variables to make all the necessary multiplications. Using the operations of division and remainder on the individual components of the date, using the getDayOfMonth(), getMonthValue(), and getYear() properties, we can retrieve each digit.\n\nLet us also explain one of the more interesting lines here. Take, for example, the second digit of the year (d6). We divide the year by 100, and we take a remainder of 10. What do we do? First, we eliminate the last 2 digits of the year by dividing by 100 (Example: 2018/100 = 20). With the remainder of 10, we take the last digit of the resulting number (20 % 10 = 0) and so we get 0, which is the second digit of 2018.\nWhat remains is to do the calculation that will give us the magical weight of a given date. In order not to write all multiplications as shown in the example, we will apply a grouping. What we need to do is multiply each digit with those that follow it. Instead of typing d1 * d2 + d1 * d3 + … + d1 * d8, we can shorten this expression to d1 * (d2 + d3 + … + d8) for grouping when we have multiplication and addition. Applying the same simplification for the other multiplications, we get the following formula:\n\nPrinting the output\nOnce we have the weight calculation of a given date, we need to check and see if it matches the magical weight, to know if it should be printed, or not. Checking can be done using a standard if block, taking care to print the date in the correct format. To format data as required in the task, we will use DateTimeFormatter class.\n\nCaution: Since we iterate over the dates from initial to final, they will always be ordered in ascending order as it is in the requirements.\nFinally, if we have not found an eligible date, we will have a false value in the found variable, and we will be able to print No.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/663#1.\nTask: Five special letters\nTwo numbers are given: start and end. Write a program that generates all combinations of 5 letters, each among the sets of {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'} so that the weight of these 5 letters is a number in the range [start … end], inclusive. Print them in alphabetical order, in a single row, separated by a space.\nThe weight of the letters is calculated as follows:\nweight('a') = 5;\nweight('b') = -12;\nweight('c') = 47;\nweight('d') = 7;\nweight('e') = -32;\n\nThe weight of the sequence of the letters c1, c2, …, cn is calculated by removing all the letters that are repeated (from right to left) and then calculating the formula:\nweight(c1c2…cn) = 1 * weight(c1) + 2 * weight(c2) + … + n * weight(cn)\n\nFor example, the weight of bcddc is calculated as follows:\nFirst, we remove the repeating letters and get bcd. Then we apply the formula: 1 * weight('b') + 2 * weight('c') + 3 * weight('d') = 1 * (-12) + 2 * 47 + 3 * 7 = 103.\nAnother example: weight(\"cadae\") = weight(\"cade\") = 1 * 47 + 2 * 5 + 3 * 7 + 4 * (-32) = -50.\nInput data\nThe input data is read from the console. It consists of two numbers:\n\nThe number for our start.\nThe number for our end.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. There is no need to check.\nOutput data\nThe result should be printed on the console as a sequence of strings, sorted in alphabetical order. Each string must be separated from the next one by a single space. If the weight of any of the 5 letter strings does not exist within the specified range, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nNumbers for start and end are integers in the range [-10000 … 10000].\nAllowed program time: 0.25 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n4042\nbcead bdcea\nweight(\"bcead\") = 41weight(\"bdcea\") = 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n-11\nbcdea cebda eaaad eaada eaadd eaade eaaed eadaa eadad eadae eadda eaddd eadde eadea eaded eadee eaead eaeda eaedd eaede eaeed eeaad eeada eeadd eeade eeaed eeead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n200300\nbaadc babdc badac badbc badca badcb badcc badcd baddc bbadc bbdac bdaac bdabc bdaca bdacb bdacc bdacd bdadc bdbac bddac beadc bedac eabdc ebadc ebdac edbac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n300400\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nLike every problem, we start the solution by reading and processing the input data. In this case, we have two integers that can be processed with a combination of the Integer.parseInt(…) and Scanner.nextLine() methods.\n\nWe have several main points in the problem – generating all combinations with a length of 5 including the 5 letters, removing repeating letters, and calculating weight for a simplified word. The answer will consist of every word whose weight is within the given range [firstNumber, secondNumber].\nGenerating all combinations\nTo generate all combinations with a length of 1 using 5 symbols, we would use a loop from 0 to 4, as we want each number of the loop to match one character. To generate any combinations of length 2, using 5 characters (i.e. \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", …, \"ba\", …), we would create two nested loops each running through the digits from 0 to 4, and we will once again make sure that each digit matches a specific character. We will repeat this step 5 times, so we will finally have 5 nested loops with indexes i1, i2, i3, i4, and i5.\n\nNow that we have all 5-digit combinations, we must find a way to \"turn\" the five digits into a word with the letters from 'a' to 'e'. One of the ways to do that is to predefine a simple string that contains the letters that we have\n\nand for each digit, we take the letter from the particular position. This way, the number 00000 will become \"aaaaa\", and the number 02423 will become \"acecd\". We can create the 5-letter string in the following way.\n\nAnother way: we can convert the digits to letters by using their arrangement in the ASCII table. The expression 'a' + i return the result 'a' in case i = 0, 'b' in case i = 1,  'c' in case i = 2, etc.\nThis way we already have generated all 5-letter combinations and can proceed with the following part of the task.\nAttention: as we have chosen a  pattern that takes into consideration the alphabetical arrangement of the letters, and cycles are run appropriately, the algorithm will generate the works in alphabetical order and there is no need for additional sorting before printing the output.\nRemoving repetitive letters\nOnce we have the finished string, we have to remove all the repeating symbols. We will do this by adding the letters from left to right in a new string, and each time before adding a letter, we will check if it already exists – if it does, we will skip it, and if it doesn't, we will add it. To begin with, we will add the first letter to the starting string.\n\nThen we will do the same with the other 4, checking each time with the following condition and the .indexOf(…) method. We can use a loop by fullWord (leaving it to the reader for exercise), and it can be done lazily by copy-paste.\n\nThe .indexOf(…) method returns the index of the particular element if it is found, or -1 if the item is not found. Therefore, every time we get -1, it means that we still do not have this letter in the new string with unique letters and we can add it, and if we get a value other than -1, this will mean we already have the letter, and we'll not add it.\nCalculating weight\nCalculating the weight is simply going through the unique word (word) obtained in the last step, and for each letter, we need to take its weight and multiply it by the position. For each letter, we need to calculate what value we will multiply its position by, for example, by using a switch construction.\n\nOnce we have the value of that letter, we should multiply it by its position. Because the indexes in the string differ by 1 from the actual positions, i.e., index 0 is position 1, index 1 is position 2, etc., we will add 1 to the indexes.\n\nAll intermediate results obtained must be added to the total amount for each letter of the 5-letter combination.\nPreparing the output\nWhether a word needs to be printed is determined by its weight. We need a condition to determine if the current weight is in the range [start … end] passed to the input at the start of the program. If this is the case, we print the full word (fullWord).\nBe careful not to print the word with unique letters. It was only needed to calculate the weight!\nThe words are separated with a space, and we will accumulate them in an intermediate variable result, which is defined as an empty string at the beginning.\n\nFinal touches\nThe condition is met unless we do not have a single word in the entered range. To find out, if we have found a word, we can check whether the string result has its initial value (i.e., an empty string). If it does, we print No else print the whole string without the last space (using the .trim ()) method.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/663#2.\n"},"chapter-09-problems-for-champions-part-2.html":{"url":"chapter-09-problems-for-champions-part-2.html","title":"9.2.

Task for champions – part II\nIn this chapter we, will review three additional tasks that belong to the category \"for champions\", i.e., they are more complex than the rest of the tasks in this book.\nMore complex tasks on the studied material\nBefore moving on to particular tasks, we must clarify that we can solve them more efficiently with additional knowledge in programming with Java (methods, arrays, collections, recursion, etc.). Each solution that we will provide now only uses the material covered in this book. The goal is to learn how to construct more complex algorithms based on your knowledge up to the present moment.\nTask: Passion shopping days\nLina has a real shopping passion. When she has some money, she immediately goes to the closest shopping center (mall) and tries to spend as much as she can on clothes, bags, and shoes. But her favorite thing is winter sales. Our task is to analyze her strange behavior, calculate the purchases that Lina does when she enters the mall, as well as the money she has left when the shopping is over. All prices and money are in BGN (Bulgarian levs, lv).\nThe first line of the input will pass the amount that Lina has before she starts shopping. Then, upon reading the \"mall.Enter\" command, Lina enters the mall and starts shopping we receive the \"mall.Exit\" command. When Lina starts shopping, on each line of the input, we will receive strings that are actions performed by Lina. Each symbol in the string is a purchase or another action. String commands contain only symbols of the ASCII table. The ASCII code of each sign is related to what Lina must pay for each of the goods. You need to interpret the symbols in the following way:\n\nIf the symbol is a capital letter, Lina gets a 50% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 50% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is a lowercase letter, Lina gets a 70% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 30% of the numeric representation of the symbol from  the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is \"%\", Lina makes a purchase that decreases her money in half.\nIf the symbol is \"*\", Lina withdraws money from her debit card and adds 10 lv. to her available funds.\nIf the symbol is different from all above, Lina just purchases without discount, and in this case, you should subtract the value of the symbol from the ASCII table from her available funds.\n\nIf any of the purchase's values is greater than her current available funds, Lina DOES NOT make the purchase. Lina's funds cannot be less than 0.\nThe shopping ends when the \"mall.Exit\" command is given. When this happens, you need to print the number of purchases made and the money that Lina has left.\nInput data\nWe will read input data from the console. The first line of the input will indicate the amount that Lina has before starting to purchase. On each of the following lines, there will be a particular command. After we receive the \"mall. Enter\" command, then on each of the following lines, we will receive commands (strings) that contain information about the purchases/actions that Lina wants to perform. We will receive strings until the \"mall.Exit\" command is given.\nWe will receive only one \"mall.Enter\" command and only one \"mall.Exit\" command.\nOutput data\nThe output data must be printed on the console.\nWhen shopping is over, you must print on the console a particular output depending on what purchases have been made.\n\nIf no purchases have been made – \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\nIf at least one purchase is made – \"{number of purchases} purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\n\nThe funds must be printed with an accuracy of up to 2 symbols after the decimal point.\nConstraints\n\nMoney is a float number within the range: [0 - 7.9 x 1028].\nThe number of strings between \"mall.Enter\" and \"mall.Exit\" will be within the range: [1-20].\nThe number of symbols in each string that represents a command will be within the range: [1-20].\nAllowed execution time: 0.1 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n110mall.Enterdmall.Exit\n1 purchases.

Money left: 58.10 lv.\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe will separate the solution of the task into three main parts:\n\nProcessing of the input.\nAlgorithm for solving the task. \nFormatting the output.\n\nLet's examine each of the parts in detail.\nProcessing the input data\nThe input of our task consists of a few components:\n\nOn the first line, we have all the money that Lina has for shopping.\nOn each of the following lines, we will have kind of command.\n\nThe first part of the reading is trivial. We should keep in mind that we will be using the BigDecimal type because we are working with money, and we need precise accuracy:\n\nThe second one contains a detail that we need to take into consideration. The requirements state the following:\n\nAfter we receive the \"mall. Enter\" command, then on each of the following lines, we will receive commands (strings) that contain information about the purchases/actions that Lina wants to perform.\n\nIt is where we need to take into consideration the fact that from the second input line on, we need to start reading commands, but only after we read the command \"mall.Enter\", we must begin processing them. How can we do this? Using a while or a do-while loop is a good option. Here is an exemplary solution of how to skip all commands before processing the command \"mall.Enter\":\n\nHere is the place to point out that calling  scanner.nextLine() after the end of the loop is used for moving to the first command for processing.\nAlgorithm for solving the task\nThe algorithm for solving the problem is a direct one – we continue reading commands from the console until the command \"mall.Exit\" is passed. In the meantime, we process each symbol (char) of each one of the commands according to the rules specified in the task requirements, and in parallel, we modify the amount that Lina has and store the number of purchases.\nLet's examine the first two sub-tasks for our algorithm. The first sub-task concerns the way we read the commands until we reach the \"mall.Exit\" command. The solution that we previously saw uses a while-loop. The second sub-task is to access each symbol of the command passed. Keeping in mind that the input data with the commands is a String type, the easiest way to access each symbol inside the strings is via a foreach loop. \nHere is how the code will look like when are using those two types of loops:\n\nThe next part of the algorithm, is to process the symbols from the commands, according to the following rules in the requirements:\n\n\nIf the symbol is a capital letter, Lina gets a 50% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 50% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is a lowercase letter, Lina gets a 70% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 30% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is \"%\",  Lina purchases that decrease her money in half.\nIf the symbol is \"*\", Lina withdraws money from her debit card and adds 10 lv. to her available funds.\nIf the symbol is different from all above, Lina just purchases without discount, and in this case, you should subtract the value of the symbol from the ASCII table from her available funds.\n\n\nLet's examine the problems that we will be facing in the first condition. The first one is how to distinguish if a particular symbol is a capital letter. We can use one of the following ways:\n\nKeeping in mind that the letters in the alphabet have a particular order, we can use the following condition action >= 'A' && action  to check if our symbol is within the capital letters range.\nWe can use the char.IsUpper(..) function.\n\nThe other problem is how to skip a particular symbol if it is not an operation that requires more money than Lina has. It is doable using the continue construction.\nAn example for the first part of the requirements looks like this:\n\nNote: the variable “purchases” is of int type, in which we store the number of all purchases.\nWe believe the reader should not have difficulties implementing all the other conditions because they are very similar to the first one.\nFormatting the output\nAt the end of our task we must print a particular output, depending on the following condition:\n\n\nIf no purchases have been made – \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\nIf at least one purchase is made – \"{number of purchases} purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\n\n\nThe printing operations are trivial. The only thing we need to keep in mind is that the amount has to be printed with an accuracy of up to 2 symbols after the decimal point.\nHow can we do that? We will leave the answer to this question to the reader.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/664#0.\nTask: Numerical expression\nBonny is an extremely powerful witch. Because her natural power is not sufficient to successfully fight vampires and werewolves, she has started to master the power of Expressions. An expression is hard to master because the spell relies on the ability to quickly solve mathematical expressions.\nTo use an \"Expression spell\" the witch must know the result of a mathematical expression in advance. An Expression spell consists of a few simple mathematical expressions. Each mathematical expression can contain operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division.\nThe expression is solved without considering the mathematical rules for calculating numerical expressions. This means that the priority is applied according to the sequence of the operators, and not the type of calculation that they do. The expression can contain brackets, as everything inside the brackets is calculated first. Every expression can contain multiple brackets but no nested brackets:\n\nAn expression containing (…(…)…) is an invalid one.\nAn expression containing (…)…(…) is a valid one.\n\nExample\nThe expression\n\nis solved in the following way:\n\nBonny is pretty but not as wise, so she will need our help to master the power of Expressions.\nInput data\nThe input data consists of a single text line passed from the console. It contains a mathematical expression for calculation. The line always ends with the \"=\" symbol. The \"=\" symbol means the end of the mathematical expression.\nThe input data is always valid and always in the described format. There is no need to validate it.\nOutput data\nThe output data must be printed on the console. The output consists of one line: the result of the calculated mathematical expression rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nConstraints\n\nThe expressions will consist of a maximum of 2500 symbols.\nThe numbers of each mathematical expression will be within the range [1 … 9].\nThe operators in the mathematical expressions will always be among + (addition), - (subtraction), / (division) or * (multiplication).\nThe result of the mathematical expression will be within the range [-100000.00 … 100000.00].\nAllowed execution time: 0.1 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4+6/5+(4*9–8)/7*2=\n8.57\n3+(6/5)+(2*3/7)*7/2*(9/4+4*1)=\n110.63\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nAs usual, we will first read and process the input, then we will solve the task, and finally, we will print the result, formatted as required.\nReading the input data\nThe input data will consist of only one text line read from the console. Here we have two ways to process the input. The first way is by reading the entire line using the bufferReader.readLine() ( where bufferReader is a variable from type BufferedReader) and accessing each symbol (char) of the line via a foreach loop. The second one is by reading the input symbol by symbol using the bufferReader.read() command and processing each symbol.\nWe will use the second option to solve the problem.\n\nAlgorithm for solving the task\nFor the tasks of our problem, we will need two variables:\n\nOne variable that will hold the current result.\nAnother variable to hold our current operator. \n\n\nAbout the code above we must clarify one detail. The default value of the operator is + so that the first detected number is added to our result.\nAfter we have declared our starting variables we must think of what our structure will look like of our program. From the condition of our task, we know that every expression is ending with =. It means we have to read and process symbols until we match with  =.  After that, we will type a while loop as shown below.\n\nThe next step is the processing of our symbol variable. We have 3 possible cases for it:\n\nIf the symbol is a start of a sub-expression placed in brackets, i.e., the found symbol is a (.\nIf the symbol is a digit between 0 and 9. But how can we check this? How can we check if our symbol is a digit? We can use for assistance the ASCII code of the symbol, via which we can use the following formula: [ASCII code of our symbol] – [ASCII code of the symbol 0] = [the digit that represents the symbol]. If the result of this condition is between 0 and 9, then our symbol is a number. ( We can also use directly '0' and '9' symbols or their ASCII codes.)\nIf the symbol is an operator, i.e., it is +, -, * or /.\n\n\nLet's examine the actions that we need to undertake in the relevant cases that we defined:\n\nIf our symbol is an operator, then the only thing we need to do is to set a new value for the expressionOperator variable.\nIf our symbol is a digit, then we need to change the current result of the expression depending on the current operator, i.e., if  expressionOperator is a -, then we must decrease the result by the numerical representation of the current symbol. We can get the numerical representation of the current symbol via the formula that we used upon checking the condition for this case (the [ASCII code of our symbol] – [the ASCII code of the symbol0] = [the digit that represents the symbol])\n\n\n\nIf our symbol is a (, this indicates the beginning of a sub-expression (an expression in brackets). By definition, the sub-expression must be calculated before modifying the result of the whole expression (the actions in brackets are performed first). It means that we will have a local result for the sub-expression and a local operator.\n\n\nAfter that, to calculate the sub-expression value, we will use the same methods that we used for calculating the main expression – we use a while loop to read symbols (until we reach an ) symbol). Depending on whether the read symbol is a number or an operator, we modify the result of the sub-expression. The implementation of these operations is identical to the above-described logic for calculating expressions. It is why we believe the reader should not have a problem with it.\nAfter completing the calculation of the result of our sub-expression, we modify the result of the whole expression depending on the value of the expressionOperator.\n\nFormatting the output\nThe only output that the program must print on the console is the result of solving the expression with an accuracy of up to two digits after the decimal point. How can we format the output this way?

Upon having a particular 4-digit secret number and a 4-digit suggested number, the following rules are applied:\n\nIf a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number and is located at the same position, we have a bull.\nIf a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number but is located at a different position, we have a cow.\n\n\n\n\nSecret number\n1\n4\n8\n1\nComment\n\n\n\n\nSuggested number\n8\n8\n1\n1\nBulls = 1Cows = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret number\n2\n2\n4\n1\nComment\n\n\n\n\nSuggested number\n9\n9\n2\n4\nBulls = 0Cows = 2\n\n\n\nUpon having a particular secret number and number of bulls and cows, our task is to find all possible suggested numbers* in ascending order.\nIf there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print \"No\".\nInput data\nOur input data consists of 3 arguments: \n\nThe first contains the secret number.\nThe second contains the number of bulls.\nThe third contains the number of cows.\n\nThe input data will always be valid. There is no need to verify them.\nOutput data\nThe output data must be printed on the console.\nThe output must consist of a single line holding all suggested numbers, space-separated.\nIf there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print “No”.\nConstraints\n\nThe secret number will always consist of 4 digits in the range [1..9].\nThe number of cows and bulls will always be in the range [0..9].\nAllowed execution time: 0.15 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n222821\n1222 2122 2212 2232 2242 2252 2262 2272 2281 2283 2284 2285 2286 2287 2289 2292 2322 2422 2522 2622 2722 2821 2823 2824 2825 2826 2827 2829 2922 3222 4222 5222 6222 7222 8221 8223 8224 8225 8226 8227 8229 9222\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n123430\n1134 1214 1224 1231 1232 1233 1235 1236 1237 1238 1239 1244 1254 1264 1274 1284 1294 1334 1434 1534 1634 1734 1834 1934 2234 3234 4234 5234 6234 7234 8234 9234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n123431\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nWe will solve the task in a few steps:\n\nWe will read the input data.\nWe will generate all possible four-digit combinations (candidates for verification).\nFor each generated combination we will calculate how many bulls and how many cows it has according to the secret number. Upon matching the needed bulls and cows, we will print the combination.\n\nReading the input data\nWe have 3 lines as input data:\n\nSecret number.\nA Number for desired bulls.\nA Number for desired cows.\n\nReading the input data is trivial:\n\nAlgorithm for solving the task\nBefore starting to write the algorithm for solving our problem, we must declare a flag that indicates whether a solution has been found:\n\nIf, after finishing our algorithm, this flag is still false, then we will print No on the console, as specified in the requirements.\n\nLet's start analyzing our problem. What we need to do is analyze all numbers from 1111 to 9999, excluding those containing zeroes (for example 9011, 3401, etc. are invalid). What is the easiest way to generate all these numbers? We will use nested loops. As we have a 4-digit number, we will have 4 nested loops, as each of them will generate an individual digit in our number for testing.\n\nThanks to these loops, we have access to every digit of all numbers that we need to check. Our next step is to separate the secret number into digits. It can be achieved very easily using a combination of integer division and modular division.\n\nOnly two last steps remain before we begin to analyze how many cows and bulls there are in a particular number. Accordingly, the first step is the declaration of counter variables in the nested loops, to count, the cows and bulls for the current number. The second step is to make copies of the digits of the current number that we will analyze, to prevent problems upon working with nested loops, in case we make changes to them.\n\nWe are ready to start analyzing the generated numbers. What logic can we use? The easiest way to check how many cows and bulls there are inside a number is via a sequence of if-else conditions. Yes, it is not the best way, but to use knowledge beyond the scope of this book, we will use this approach.\nWhat conditions do we need?\nThe condition for the bulls is simple – we check whether the first digit of the generated number matches the same digit in the secret number. We remove the digits that are already checked to avoid repetitions of bulls and cows.\n\nWe repeat the action for the second, third, and fourth digits. \nWe will apply the following condition for the cows – first, we will check whether the first digit of the generated number matches the second one, the third one, or the fourth digit of the secret number. An example for the implementation:\n\nThen, we check: whether the second digit of the generated number matches the first one, the third one, or the fourth digit of the secret number; whether the third digit of the generated number matches the first one, the second one, or the fourth digit of the secret number; and finally, we check whether the fourth digit of the generated number matches the first one, the second one or the third digit of the secret number.\nPrinting the output\nAfter completing all conditions, we need to check whether the bulls and cows in the currently generated number match the desired bulls and cows read from the console. If this is true, we print the current number on the console.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/664#2.\n"},"chapter-10-methods.html":{"url":"chapter-10-methods.html","title":"10. Methods","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 10. Methods\nIn this chapter, we will introduce you to methods. We will learn what they are, what is their base concepts when working with them. We will learn why it is a good practice to use them, how to declare and call them. We will also introduce you to the parameters and return value of a method and how to use that return value. At the end of this chapter, we will look at the established practices when using methods.\nWhat is \"method\"?\nSo far, we have found out that while writing a code for a program that solve a task, separating the task into different parts favors us a lot. Every part is responsible for a corresponding action and by doing so, it is easier to solve the task, and the readability and the debugging of the code are better.\nA block of code designed to perform a particular task, which we have logically separated is called a method. Methods – pieces of code, that are named by us in a certain way and could be called as many times as we need.\nA method can be called as many times as we think we need to solve a problem. That saves us from repeating the same code several times, reduces the possibility of making a mistake while editing the repeated code.\nSimple methods\nSimple methods are responsible for running a specific action that will help us to solve a problem. Those actions can be printing a string on the console, performing some checks, performing a loop, etc.\nLet's look at the following example of a simple method:\n\nThis method has the task to print a header containing a series of the symbol -. Because of this, the name of the method is printHeader. The parentheses ( and ) always follows the name, no matter how we have named the method. Later we will take a look at how we should name methods. For now, we will only say that the name of a method must describe the action he performs.\nThe body of the method consists of programming code, which is located between the curly brackets { and }. Between them, we place code, that will solve our problem, described by the name of the method.\nWhy should we use methods?\nUp to this moment, we have found out that, methods help us with separating big tasks into smaller parts, which leads to a simple solution of the corresponding problem. It makes our program, not just well structured, easy readable but also more understandable.\nUsing methods, we escape repeating of programming code. Repeating code is a bad practice, as it makes it very difficult to maintain the program and leads to errors. If one part of code exists in our program more than once and we have to fix it, we will have to change at every occurrence it. The probability of us forgetting one of the repeated places is high, which will lead to incorrect behavior of our program. It is why it's a good practice to define a fragment that will be used more than once as a separate method.\nMethods offer us an opportunity to use code several times. With solving more and more tasks, we will conclude that using already defined methods saves us much time and effort.\nDeclaring methods\nIn Java language, you can declare methods inside a class, i.e., between the opening { and closing } brackets of the classbut not in the declaration of another method. The declaration is the registration of the method in the program, and thus the method will be recognized in the rest of it. The best-known example is the main(…) method, which we use in every program we write.\n\nWith the next example, we will look at the mandatory elements in the declaration of a method.\n\n\nThe type of the returned value. In this case, the type is double, which means that the method will return a result, which is of double type. The returned value can be int, double, string, etc., and also void. If the type is void, this means that the method doesn't return a result, but only does a particular operation.\nMethod name. The name of the method is defined by us, but we should not forget that it has to describe the function, executed by the code in its body. In the example, the name is GetSquare, which tells us that this method calculates the area of a square.\nParameters list is declared between the parentheses ( and ) that we write after its name. Here we list all the parameters that the method will use. There can be only one parameter, multiple ones, or it could be an empty list. If there are no parameters, we will write only the parentheses (). In this example, we declare one parameter with a name side and with a type double.\nstatic declaration in the method description. For the moment, we can accept that we write static always when we declare a method. Later, when we get familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP), we will learn about the difference between static methods (shared for the whole class) and methods of an object, which work on the data of a particular instance of the class (object).\n\nWhen declaring methods, you must follow the sequence of its base elements – first is the keyword static then the type of the returned value, then method name, and finally list of parameters, surrounded by parentheses (). \nAfter we have declared a method, its implementation (body) follows. In the body of the method, we write down the algorithm, by which it solves a problem, i.e., the body contains the code (program block), which applies the method's logic. In the example above we calculate the area of a square, which is side * side. \nWhen declaring a variable in the body of a method, it is called a local variable. The area where this variable exists and can be used starts from the line where we have declared it and reaches the closing curly bracket } of the body of the method. This area is called variable scope.\nCalling a method\nCalling a method means starting to execute the code, which is in the body of the method. It happens by writing its name, followed by parentheses () and the semicolon sign ; to end the line. If the method needs input data, it is given in the parentheses (), and the succession of the parameters should be the same as one of the given parameters when declaring the method. Here is an example:\n\nA method can be called from several places in the program. One way is to call it inside the main method.\n\nA method can also be called from the body of another method, which is not the main method of the program.\n\nA method can be called from its own body. It is called recursion and you can find more about it on Wikipedia or google it.\nIt is important to know that if a method is declared in a class, it can be called before the line, on which it has been declared.\nExample: Blank receipt\nWrite a method that prints a blank receipt. The method should call another three methods: one to print the upper part, one for the middle part of the receipt, and one for the bottom part.\n\n\n\nPart of cash receipt\nText\n\n\n\n\nUpper part\nCASH RECEIPT------------------------------\n\n\nMiddle part\nCharged to____________________Received by___________________\n\n\nBottom part\n------------------------------(c) SoftUni\n\n\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n(no input)\nCASH RECEIPT------------------------------Charged to____________________Received by___________________------------------------------(c) SoftUni\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe first step is to create a void method to print the upper part of the receipt (header). Let's give it a meaningful name, which describes what the method does, e.g., PrintReceiptHeader. In its body, write the code from the example below:\n\nIn the same way, we'll create two more methods: one to print the middle part of the receipt (body) PrintReceiptBody and another to print the bottom part of the receipt (footer) PrintReceiptFooter.\nAfter this we will create another method, which will call the three methods we already wrote, one after the other:\n\nFinally, we'll call the PrintReceipt method from the body of the Main method of our program:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nThe program with a total of five methods that call one another is ready and we can run and debug it. After that, we will send it for test in the Judge system: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#0.\nMethods with parameters\nOften to solve a problem, the method by which we achieve this needs additional information, which depends on its purpose. This information represents the parameters of the method , and its behavior depends on them. \nUsing parameters in methods\nAs we noted above, the parameters can be zero, one or more. When declaring them, you should divide them with a comma. They can be of any type (int, string, etc.), and below is an example of how they are used by the method.\nWe declare the method and its list of parameters, then we write the code that the method executes.\n\nAfter that call the method and give it particular values:\n\nWhen declaring parameters, we can use various types of variables, and we should be careful that every parameter has a type and name. It is important to note that when calling the method, we must pass to its values for the parameters in the order, in which they are declared. If the parameters are first int and after that string, when calling the method, we can't give it first a string and then int. \nLet's look at the example for declaring a method, which has several parameters of different types.\n\nExample: Sign of an integer\nCreate a method that prints the sign of an integer n.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\nThe number 2 is positive.\n\n\n-5\nThe number -5 is negative.\n\n\n0\nThe number 0 is zero.\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe first step is creating a method and giving it a descriptive name, e.g., PrintSign. This method will have only one parameter of int type. \n\nThe next step is implementing the logic by which the program will check what the sign of the number is. You can see from the examples that there are three cases – the number is greater than, equals to, or less than zero, which means that we'll make three verifications in our method.\nThe next step is to read the input number and to call the new method from the body of the main method.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#1.\nExample: Printing a triangle\nCreate a method that prints a triangle as shown in the examples.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n11 21 2 31 21\n4\n11 21 2 31 2 3 4 1 2 31 21\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nBefore creating a method to print a row with a given beginning and an end, we must read the input number from the console. After that, we choose a meaningful name, which describes its purpose, e.g., printLine, and implements it.\n\nFrom the drawing exercises, we remember that it is а good practice to divide the figure into several parts. To make it easier, we will divide the triangle into three parts – upper, middle, and bottom.\nThe next step is to print the upper half of the triangle using a loop:\n\nAfter that, we will print the middle part:\n\nFinally, we will print the bottom part from the triangle, but this time with a reverse loop.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#2.\nExample: Draw a filled square\nPrint on the console a filled square with side n, as in the examples below.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n---------\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/---------\n5\n-----------\\/\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/\\/-----------\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe first step is to read the input from the console. After that, we need to create a method, which will print the first and the last rows because they are the same. Let's remember that we must give it a descriptive name and give it as a parameter the length of the side. We will use the constructor's new String. \n\nOur next step is to create a method that will draw the middle rows on the console. Again, give it a descriptive name i.e., printMiddleRow.\n\nFinally, call the methods in the main() method of the program to draw the whole square:\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#3.\nReturning result from a method\nSo far, we have looked at methods that do a specific task, for example, printing a text, number, or figure on the console. There is another type of method that can return a result from their task. We will look at this type of method in the following lines.\nTypes of returned values\nSo far, we saw some examples, in which when declaring methods, we used the keyword void, which shows that the method does not return a result, but just executes a certain action.\n\nIf we replace void with a type of some variable, this will tell the program that the method should return a value of the said type. This returned value could be of any type – int, String, double, etc. \n\nFor a method to return a result we need to write the type of returned value we expect when declaring the method, in place of the void.\n\n\n\nWe should note that the result returned by the method can be of a type, compatible with the type of the returned value of the method. For example, if the declared type of the returned value is double, we can return a value of int type.\nThe \"return\" operator\nTo obtain a result from the method, we need to use the return operator. It should be used in the body of the method and tells the program to stop its execution and to return to the method's caller, a value that is defined by the expression after the return operator.\nIn the example below, there is a method that reads two names from the console, concatenates them, and returns them as a result. The return value is of String type:\n\nThe return operator can also be used in void methods. This way, the method will stop its execution without returning a value, and after it, there shouldn't be an expression, which should be returned. In this case, we use return only to exit the method.\nThere are cases where return can be called, from multiple places in the method, but only if there are certain input conditions.\nWe have a method in the example below, which compares two numbers and returns a result respectively -1, 0, or 1 depending on if the first argument is less than, equals to, or greater than the second argument, given to the method. The method uses the keyword return in three different places, to return three different values according to the logic of comparing the numbers:\n\nCode after a return is unreachable\nWhen the return operator is located inside a conditional statement such as if, after the statement in the same block, we must not have rows with code because IntelliJ IDEA will display a warning telling us that it had found an unreachable statement.\n\n\nIn programming, we can't have 2 times the operator return one after another because the first return won't allow us to use the second. Sometimes programmers joke\nwith the phrase write return; return; and let's go home”, to explain that the logic of the program is wrongly typed.\n\n\nUsing the return value of a method\nAfter a method is executed and has returned a value, we can use the value in several ways.\nThe first is to assign the result to a variable:\nint max = getMax(5, 10);\n\nThe second is to be used inside an expression:\ndouble total = getPrice() * quantity * 1.2;\n\nThe third is to pass the result from one method to another method:\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint age = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());\n\nExample: Calculating triangle area\nCreate a method that calculates the area of a triangle using the given base and height and returns it as a result.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n34\n6\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nThe first step is to read the input. After that, create a method, but this time be careful when declaring to give it the correct type of data we want the method to return, which is double\n\nThe next step is to call the new method from the main() method and to store the returned value in a suitable variable.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#4.\nExample: Power of a number\nWrite a method that calculates and returns the result the power of a number. \nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n28\n256\n34\n81\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nOur first step is to read the input data from the console. The next step is to create a method that will take two parameters (the number and the power) and return, as a result, a number of a double type.\n\nAfter we have done the calculations, we have to only print the result in the main() method of the program.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#5.\nMethod overloading\nIn many programming languages, the same methods can be declared in different variants with the same name and different parameters. It is known as “method overloading”. Now let's see how to write these overloaded methods.\nMethod signature\nIn programming methods are identified through the elements of their declaration: name of the method + a list of its parameters. These two elements define its specification, the so-called “method signature”.\n\nIn this example, the method's signature is its name (print), together with its parameter (String text).\nIf our program holds several methods with the same name, but with different lists of parameters (signatures), we can say that we use method overloading.\nOverloading methods\nAs we mentioned, if you use the same name for several methods with different signatures, this means that you are overloading a method. The code below shows how three different methods can use the same name but have different signatures and execute different actions.\n\nSignature and return value type\nIt is important to say that the returned type as a result of the method is not a part of its signature. If the returned type was a part of the signature, then the compiler doesn't know which method exactly to call (there is ambiguity).\nLet's look at the following example: we have two methods with different return types. Even though IntelliJ IDEA shows that there is an error, our compiler won't know which of the two methods to invoke because they are with the same name print().\n\nExample: Greater of two values\nThe input is two values of the same type. The values can be of int, char, or String type. Create a method getMax() that returns, as a result, the greater of the two values.\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nint216\n16\ncharaz\nz\nstringIvanTodor\nTodor\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nTo complete our task, we need to create three methods with the same name and different signatures. First, we create a method, which will compare integers.\n\nFollowing the logic of the previous method, we create another one with the same name, but this one will compare characters.\n\nThe next method we need to create will compare strings. The logic here is a bit different from the previous two methods because variables of String type cannot be compared with the operators  and >. We will use the method compareTo(…), which returns a numerical value: greater than 0 (the compared object is larger), less than 0 (the compared object is smaller), and 0 (the two objects are the same).\n\nThe last step is to read the input data, use the appropriate variables, and invoke the method getMax() from the body of the main() method.\n\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#6.\nNaming methods. Best practices when working with methods\nIn this chapter, we will introduce you to some of the best practices when working with methods. They will be related to naming, organizing our code and its structure. \nNaming methods\nWhen we name a method, it's recommended to use logical name. This is good because every method must correspond to a specific part of our problem. We must take into consideration the task which the method will do. This is why it's a good practice for the name to describes the purpose of the method.\nIt is required for the name of the method to start with a small letter and to be a verb or a combination of a verb and a noun. Formatting the names must be done following Lower Camel Case convention - every word except the first to start with an upper letter. Round brackets  ( and ) are always after the name of the method.\nEvery method must do an independent task, and the name must describe its role.\nHere are some examples of correctly named methods:\n\nfindStudent\nloadReport\nsine\n\nSome examples of badly named methods:\n\nMethod1\nDoSomething\nHandleStuff\nSampleMethod\nDirtyHack\n\nIf we can't come up with a good name, it's probably because our method does more than one job or it doesn't have a clear task. We must think of a way to divide the method into several separate methods.\nNaming parameters of methods\nWhen naming the parameters of a method you can apply almost the same rules as with the methods themselves. The difference here is that it is good for the names of the parameters to use a noun or a couple of an adjective and a noun, and when naming the parameters, we use the lowerCamelCase convention, i.e., each word except for the first one starts with uppercase. We should note that it is a good practice that the name of the parameter shows what unit is used when working with it.\nHere are some examples of correctly named parameters of methods:\n\nfirstName\nreport\nspeedKmH\nusersList\nfontSizeInPixels\nfont\n\nSome examples of incorrectly named parameters: \n\np\np1\np2\npopulate\nLastName\nlast_name\n\nGood practices when working with methods\nWe must keep in mind that a method must do only one specific task. If this can't be achieved, then we must come up with a way to divide the functionality into different parts.\nAs we have already said, the name must be clear and descriptive. Another good practice is to avoid methods that are longer than our screen. If this happens, it's recommended to split the method into smaller ones, as shown in the example below.\n\nStructure and formatting of the code\nWhen writing methods, we must keep in mind to follow a correct indentation (offset blocks of code).\nHere are some examples of correctly formatted Java code:\n\nSome examples of incorrectly formatted Java code:\n\nWhen the headline row of the method is too long, it's recommended to divide it into several rows, moving each row after the first one with two  tabs to the right (for better readability):\n\nAnother good practice is to leave an empty row between methods, after loops, and conditional statements. You should avoid writing long rows and complicated expressions. Over time you will find out that improves the readability and saves time.\nWe recommend you to always use curly brackets for the body of conditional statements and loops. The brackets don't just improve the readability but also reduce the possibility of making a mistake.\nWhat have we learned from this chapter?\nIn this chapter, we have learned base concepts about working with methods:\n\nWe learned that the goal of a method is to split programs with many rows of code into smaller and shorter parts.\nWe got acquainted with the structure of methods and how to declare and call them by their name.\nWe looked into different examples of methods with parameters and how to use them in our program.\nWe learned what the signature and the return value of the method are and what the role of the return operator is in the methods.\nWe learned about good practices for working with methods, how to name them and their parameters, how to format our code, and others.\n\nExercises\nTo improve what we have learned, we will solve a few exercises. In them, it is required to write a method with specific functionality and then call it with values read from the console, as shown in the example. \nTask: \"Hello, Name!\"\nWrite a method that takes a name as a parameter and prints on the console \"Hello, \\!\".\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nPeter\nHello, Peter!\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nDefine a method printName(String name) and implement it, after which read a name from the console in the main program and invoke the method by giving him the name.\nTesting in the Judge system\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/665#7.\nTask: Min method\nCreate a method getMin(int a, int b), which returns the smaller of two numbers. Write a program, which takes as input three numbers and prints the smallest of them.

After the headline of the message print as much =, as the length of the said headline and print an empty line after each message (to understand in detail look at the examples). \nThe task should be solved by defining four methods: showSuccessMessage(), showWarningMessage(), showErrorMessage() and readAndProcessMessage(), so that only the last method is called in the main() method:\n\nSample input and output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4errorcredit card purchaseInvalid customer address500warningEmail not confirmedsuccessuser registrationUser registered successfullywarningCustomer has not email assigned\nError: Failed to execute credit card purchase.==============================================Reason: Invalid customer address.Error code: 500.Warning: Email not confirmed.=============================Successfully executed user registration.========================================User registered successfully.Warning: Customer has not email assigned.=========================================\n\n\n\nHints and guidelines\nDefine and implement the four shown methods.\nIn ReadAndProcessMessage() read the type of message from the console and according to the read, type read the rest of the data (one, two, or three more lines). After that call the method for printing the given type of message.\nIf you are reading from the console a few separate methods, you should keep in mind that you should create Scanner object only once (for example in the main method) and pass it to the other methods as a parameter.

Tricks and Hacks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 11. Tricks and Hacks\nIn the current chapter, we are going to see some tricks, hacks and techniques, which will make our work with C# easier in the IntelliJ IDEA. In particular, we will see:\n\nHow to properly format our code\nConventions for naming elements in the code\nSome keyboard shortcuts\nSome code snippets\nTechniques to debug our code\n\nCode Formatting\nThe right formatting of our code will make it easier to read and understand in case someone else needs to work with it. This is important because in practice we will need to work in a team with other people and it is highly important to write our code in a way that our colleagues can quickly understand it.\nThere are some defined rules for correct formatting of the code, which are collected in one place and are called conventions. The conventions are a group of rules, generally accepted by the programmers using a given language, which are massively used. These conventions help to build norms in given languages – what is the best way to write and what are good practices. It is accepted that if a programmer follows them then his code is easy to read and understand.\nThe Java language is developed by Sun Microsystems (a tech company, later acquired by Oracle). Sun is the ones that lay the foundations of the current well-established conventions in Java. You should know that even if you don't follow the conventions given by Microsoft, your code will work (as long as it is properly written), but it will not be easy to understand. This, of course, is not fatal at a base level, but the faster you get used to writing quality code the better.\nThe Official Java Code Conventions\nThe most widely adopted modern Java convention is called Google Java Style Guide and this book will be closely following it.\nFor code formatting in the Java ecosystem, the following is recommended for the curly brackets {} - the opening bracket is supposed to be on the same line and the closing bracket should be right underneath the construct:\nif (someCondition) {\n    System.out.println(\"Inside the if statement\");\n}\n\nYou can see that the command System.out.println(…) in the example is indented by 4 white spaces (one tab), which is a standard in Java. If the given block enclosed in curly brackets is indented by any number of tabs, then the closing curly bracket } must be right below the beginning of the construct, as in the example below:\nif (someCondition) {\n   if (anotherCondition) {\n       System.out.println(\"Inside the if statement\");\n   }\n}\n\nBelow you can see an example for badly formatted code according to the accepted conventions for writing code in Java:\nif(someCondition)\n{\nSystem.out.println(\"Inside the if statement\");}\n\nThe first thing that we see is the curly brackets {}. The first (opening) bracket should be just after the if condition, and the second (closing) bracket – below the command System.out.println(…), at a new and empty line. In addition, the command inside the if construction should be offset by 4 white spaces (one tab). Just after the keyword if, before the condition and preceding the { you should put a space.\nThe same rule applies for the for loops and all other constructions with curly brackets {}. Here are some more examples:\nCorrect formatting:\nfor (int i = 0; i \nWrong formatting:\nfor(int i=0;i\nCode Formatting Shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA\nFor your comfort, there are keyboard shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA, which we will explain later in this chapter, but for now, we are interested in two specific combinations. One of the combinations is for formatting the code in the whole document, and the other one – for formatting a part of the code. If we want to format the whole code we need to press [CTRL + ALT + L]. In case we need to format only a part of the code, we need to mark this part with the mouse and press [Ctrl + Shift + Alt + L].\nLet's use the wrongly formatted example from earlier:\nfor(int i=0;i\nIf we press [CTRL + ALT + L], which is the combination to format the whole document, we will have a code, formatted according to the accepted conventions for Java, which will look as follows:\nfor (int i = 0; i \nThis key combination in IntelliJ IDEA can help us if we work with a badly formatted code.\nNaming Code Elements\nIn this section, we will focus on the accepted conventions for naming projects, files and variables, defined by Microsoft.\nNaming Projects and Files\nIt is recommended to use a descriptive name for naming projects and files, which suggests the role of the respective file / project and at the same time the PascalCase convention is also recommended. This is a convention for naming elements, in which each word, including the first one, starts with an uppercase character, for example ExpressionCalculator.\nExample: This course starts with a First steps in coding lecture, therefore an exemplary name for the solution for this lecture can be FirstStepsInCoding. The same convention applies to the files in a project. If we take for example the first problem in the First steps in coding lecture, it is called Hello World, therefore our file in the project will be called HelloWorld.\nNaming Variables\nIn programming variables keep data, and for the code to be more understandable, the name of a variable should suggest its purpose. Here are some recommendations for naming variables:\n\nThe name should be short and descriptive and explain what the variable serves for.\nThe name should only contain the letters a-z, A-Z, the numbers 0-9, and the symbols '$' and '_'.\nIt is accepted in Java for the variables to always begin with a lowercase letter and to contain lowercase letters, and each next word in them should start with an uppercase letter (this naming is also known as camelCase convention).\nYou should be careful about uppercase and lowercase letters because Java distinguishes them. For example, age and Age are different variables.\nThe names of the variables cannot coincide with keywords in the Java language, for example int is an invalid name for a variable.\n\n\nAlthough using the symbol _ in the names of variables is allowed, in Java it is not recommended and is considered a bad style of naming.\n\n\nNaming – Examples\nHere are some examples for well-named variables:\n\nfirstName\nage\nstartIndex\nlastNegativeNumberIndex\n\nHere are some examples for badly named variables, even though the names are correct according to the Java compiler:\n\n_firstName (starts with '_')\nlast_name (contains '_')\nAGE (written in uppercase, which is a badly named variable but well-named constant)\nStart_Index (starts with an uppercase letter and contains '_')\nlastNegativeNumber_Index (contains '_')\n\nAt first look, all these rules can seem meaningless and unnecessary, but with time passed and experience gaining you will see the need for conventions for writing quality code to be able to work more easily and faster in a team. You will understand that the work with a code, which is written without complying with any rules for code quality, is annoying.\nShortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA\nIn the previous section, we mentioned two of the combinations that are used for formatting code. One of them [Ctrl + Alt + L] is used for formatting the whole code in a file, and the second one [Ctrl + Shift + Alt + L] serves if we want to format just a piece of the code. These combinations are called shortcuts and now we will give more thorough information about them.\nShortcuts are combinations that give us the possibility to do some things in an easier and faster way, and each IDE has its shortcuts, even though most of them are recurring. Now we will look at some of the shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA:\n\n\n\nCombination\nAction\n\n\n\n\n[CTRL + F]\nOpens the search window, by which we can search in our code.\n\n\n[CTRL + /]\nComments part of the code. / Uncomments a code, which is already commented.\n\n\n[CTRL + Z]\nBrings back one change (so-called Undo).\n\n\n[Ctrl + Shift + Z]\nThe combination is opposite of [CTRL + Z] (the so-called Redo).\n\n\n[CTRL + ALT + L]\nFormats the code according the default conventions.\n\n\n[CTRL + Backspace]\nDeletes the word to the left of the cursor.\n\n\n[CTRL + Del]\nDeletes the word to the right of the cursor.\n\n\n[CTRL + Shift + S]\nSaves all files in the project.\n\n\n[CTRL + S]\nSaves the current file.\n\n\n[CTRL + D]\nCopies the current line or the selected fragment.\n\n\n[CTRL + Y]\nDeletes the current line.\n\n\n\nMore about the shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA* can be found here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/keyboard-shortcuts-by-category.html.\nCode Snippets in IntelliJ IDEA\nIn IntelliJ IDEA there are the so-called code snippets, which write a block of code by using a code template. For example, by writing the short code sout + [Enter] the following code is generated in the body of our program, in the place of the short code:\nSystem.out.println();\n\nThis is called “unfolding a code snippet”. The fori + [Enter] snippet works in the same way. On the figure below you can see the sout snippet in action:\n\nCreating Your Code Snippet\nIn this section, we are going to show you how to make your code snippet. We will see how to make a code snippet for scanner.nextLine();. To begin we must create a new empty project in IntelliJ IDEA and go to [File → Settings → Editor → Live Templates], and choose [+ → Live Template] as shown on the picture:\n\nA new window that looks like the one on the image below pops up:\n\nThe following information should be entered:\n\n[Abbreviation] - we specify the code snippet that we wish to use. In our case this is scnl.\n[Description] - this is the place for our snippet's description. In our case this is scanner.nextLine().\n[Template text] - we enter the code to be generated in the event of snippet usage. In our case this is:\n\nScanner scanner = new scanner(Sysrtem.in);\nString s = scanner.nextLine();\n\nNext we select [Reformat according to style] and choose [Java] from [Define] list. To finish the procedure press [OK] as it's shown in the picture below:\n\nNow when we write scnl in IntelliJ IDEA, our new snippet is going to appear:\n\nCode Debugging Techniques\nDebugging plays an important role in the process of creating software, which allows us to follow the implementation of our program step by step. With this technique, we can follow the values of the local variables, because they are changing during the execution of the program, and to remove possible errors (bugs). The process of debugging includes:\n\nFinding the problems (bugs).\nLocating the code, which causes the problems.\nCorrecting the code, which causes the problems, so that the program works correctly.\nTesting to make sure that the program works correctly after the corrections we have made.\n\nDebugging in IntelliJ IDEA\nIntelliJ IDEA gives us a built-in debugger, thanks to which we can place breakpoints at places we have chosen. When it reaches a breakpoint, the program stops running and allows step-by-step running of the remaining lines. Debugging allows us to get into the details of the program and see where exactly the errors occur and what is the reason for this.\nTo demonstrate how to use the debugger we will use the following program:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    for (int i = 0; i \nWe will place a breakpoint at the function System.out.println(…). For this, we will need to move our cursor to the line, which prints on the console, and press [Ctrl + F8], alternatively we can simply click using the left mouse button on the right side of the line number. A breakpoint appears, showing where the program will stop running:\n \nStarting the Program in Debug Mode\nTo start the program in debug mode, we choose [Run] -> [Debug ] or press [SHIFT + F9]:\n \nAfter starting the program, we can see that it stops executing at line 8, where we placed our breakpoint. The code in the current line is colored in additional color and we can run it step by step. To go to the next line, we use the key [F8]. We can see that the code on the current line hasn't been executed yet. It will execute when we go ahead with debugging the next line. The current value of the variable is depicted in green, in this case, i = 0 can be seen in the following picture.\n \nFrom the [Variables] window we can observe the changes in the local variables.\n  \nTricks for Java Developers\nIn this section, we will recall some tricks and techniques in programming with Java, already seen in this book, which can be very useful if you attend an exam for beginner programming.\nFormatted output with printf()\nFor printing long and complex sequences of elements, we can use the printf(…) method. This method is an abbreviation of \"Print Formatted\". The main idea of printf(…) is to take a special string formatted with special formatting symbols and a comma-separated list of values that have to substitute the formatting specifiers.\nprintf(, , , , …)\n\nExample:\nString str = \"some text\";\nSystem.out.printf(\"%s\", str);\n// This will print on the console \"some text\"\n\nThe first argument of the printf(…) method is the formatting string. In this case %s means that %s is going to be substituted by the string str and the value of str is what you'll see printed on the console.\nString str1 = \"some text\";\nint number = 5;\nString str2 = \"some more text\";\nSystem.out.printf(\"%s %d %s \\n\", str1, number, str2);\n// This will print on the console \"some text 5 some more text\"\n\nNotice that in this example we can pass non-exclusively string variables. The first argument is a formatting string. Following it comes a sequence of arguments that are replacing any instance of a formatting specifier (meaning % followed by a single character, e.g. %s or %d). The first %s means that the first argument that is passed after the formatting string, is going to take its place, in our case that's str1. After that, there's %d which means that it's going to be substituted by the first integer number that is among the arguments. The last special symbol is %s which means that it'll be replaced by the next string that can be found in the arguments. Finally, there's \\n and that is a special symbol that denotes a new line. A single variable can be used multiple times.\nString str = \"some text\";\nint number = 5;\nSystem.out.printf(\"%s %d %s \\n\", str, number, str);\n// This will print on the console \"some text 5 some text\"\n\nRounding of floating-point numbers\nReal numbers are represented in Java with the types float and double.\ndouble number = 5.432432;\nSystem.out.println(Math.round(number));\n// This will print on the console \"5\"\n\nIf the digit at the first decimal place is less than 5, just like in the example above, then the number is rounded down, otherwise - it's rounded up as you can see in the example below:\ndouble number = 5.543;\nSystem.out.println(Math.round(number));\n// This will print on the console \"6\"\n\nOther Rounding Methods\nIn case we always want to round down instead of Math.round(…) we can use another method – Math.floor(…), which always rounds down. For example, if we have the number 5.99 and we use Math.floor(5.99), we will get the number 5.0*.\nWe can also do the exact opposite – to always round up using the method Math.ceil(…). Again, if we have for example 5.11 and we use Math.ceil(5.11), we will get 6.0. Here are some examples:\ndouble numberToFloor = 5.99;\nSystem.out.println(Math.floor(numberToFloor));\n// This will print on the console 5.0\n\ndouble numberToCeiling = 5.11;\nSystem.out.println(Math.ceil(numberToCeiling));\n// This will print on the console 6.0\n\nFormatting with 2 Digits After the Decimal Point\nWhen we print numbers, we often need to round them to 2 digits after the decimal point, e.g.\ndouble number = 5.432432;\nSystem.out.printf(\"%.2f%n\", number);\n// This will print on the console 5.43\n\nIn the given example a formatting string %.2f is used, which rounds the number variable to two decimal places. We have to take into account that the number before the letter f means the number of decimal places up to which the result will be rounded (e.g. the formatting string can very well be %.3f or %.5f). When formatting a string using printf(), it's recommended to use %n as a symbol for new line and not /n.\nHow to Write a Conditional Statement?\nThe conditional if construction contains the following elements:\n\nKeyword if\nA Boolean expression (condition)\nBody of the conditional construction\nOptional: else clause\n\nif (condition) {\n    // body\n} else (condition) {\n    // body\n}\n\nTo make it easier we can use a code snippet for an if construction:\n\nif + [Enter]\n\nHow to Write a 'For' Loop?\nFor a for loop we need a couple of things:\n\nInitializing block, in which the counter variable is declared (int i) and its initial value is set\nCondition for repetition (i )\nLoop variable (counter) updating statement (i++)\nBody of the loop, holding statements\n\nfor (int i = 0; i \nIt's important to know that the three elements of the for loop are optional and can be omitted. for(; ; ) { … } is a valid for loop statement.\nTo make it easier we can use a code snippet for a for loop:\n\nfori + [Enter]\n\nWhat Have We Learned in This Chapter?\nIn this chapter, we have learned how to correctly format and name the elements of our code, some shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA, some code snippets, and we analyzed how to debug the code.\n"},"chapter-12-conclusion.html":{"url":"chapter-12-conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nIf you have read the entire book and you've solved all the problems from the exercises and reached the present conclusion, congratulations! You've already made the first step in learning the profession of a programmer, but there is a long way to go until you become really good and make software writing your profession.\nDeveloper skills\nRemember the four main groups of skills that each programmer must have in order to work in the industry:\n\nSkill #1 – writing the program code (20% of programmer's skills) – covered to a large degree by this book, but you must learn additional basic data structures, classes, objects, functions, strings, and other elements of code writing.\nSkill #2 – algorithmic thinking (30% of programmer's skills) – covered partially by this book and developed mostly by solving a large amount of diverse algorithmic problems.\nSkill #3 – a fundamental understanding of the profession (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired for a few years in combination with learning and practice (reading books, watching video lessons, attending courses, and mostly by writing diverse projects in various technological areas).\nSkill #4 – programming languages and software technologies (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired in a long period, by a lot of practice, consistent reading and writing projects. Such knowledge and skills quickly get outdated and need to be updated frequently. Good programmers are involved in studying new technologies every day.\n\nThis book is only the first step!\nThe present book on programming basics is just the first step in building the skills of a programmer. If you were able to solve all problems, this means you have obtained valuable knowledge in the programming principles with Java on a basic level. You are about to start in-depth studying of programming, and develop your algorithmic thinking, and then add technological knowledge regarding the Java language and the Java ecosystem (Java EE, Spring, Android, etc.), front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and many other concepts, technologies and instruments for software development.\nIf you were not able to solve all problems or a large part of them, go back and solve them! Remember that becoming a programmer requires a lot of work and effort. This profession is not for lazy people. There is no way to learn it unless you seriously practice programming for years!\nAs we've already explained, the first and basic skill of a programmer is to learn to write code with ease and pleasure. This is namely the mission of this book: to teach you how to code. We recommend you, besides reading the book, to enroll in the practical course \"Programming Basics\" at SoftUni, which is offered for free, in on-site, or online format of training.\nHow to proceed after this book?\nThis book gives you a solid foundation, thanks to which it will be easy for you to continue developing as a programmer. If you wonder how to continue your development, you have the following possibilities:\n\nto study for a software engineer at SoftUni and make programming your profession;\nto continue developing as a programmer in your own way, for example, through self-training or via online lessons;\nto stay at coder level, without going more seriously into programming.\n\nStudy software engineering in SoftUni\nThe first and respectively recommended opportunity to master completely and on a high level the profession of a \"software engineer\" is to start your training via the end-to-end SoftUni program for software engineers: https://softuni.org. The SoftUni curriculum is carefully developed by Dr. Svetlin Nakov and his team, to provide you consequently and with gradually increasing complexity, all the skills that a software engineer must possess, to start a career as a software developer in an IT company.\nTraining duration in SoftUni\nThe training in SoftUni has a duration of 1-2 years (depending on the profession and the selected specializations), and during that period it is normal to reach a good starting level (junior developer), but this is only if you study seriously and write code intensely every day. Upon having good grades, a typical student starts a job around the middle of the training (after around 1.5 years). Thanks to the well-developed partner's network, the career center of SoftUni offers work in a software or IT company to all SoftUni students who have very good or excellent grades. Starting a job in the major, in case of having good grades at SoftUni, combined with a willingness to work and reasonable expectations towards the employers, is almost guaranteed.\nIt takes at least a year of intense code writing to become a programmer\nKeep in mind that to become a programmer takes a lot of effort, writing tens of thousands of lines of code, and solving hundreds, even thousands of practical tasks, and this takes years! If someone offers you \"an easier program\" and promises you to become a programmer and start working within 3-4 months, then either they are lying to you, or they will give you such a low level, that companies won't even take you as a trainee, even if you pay to the company that is wasting its time with you. There are exceptions, of course, for example if you are not starting from scratch, or if you have extremely well-developed engineering thinking, or if you apply for a very low position (for example technical support), but in general, you cannot become a programmer if you haven't spent at least 1 year of intense learning and code writing!\nThe entrance exam in SoftUni\nIn order to enroll at SoftUni, you need to attend an entrance exam in \"Programming Basics\" on the material from this book. If you easily solve the tasks in this book, then you are ready for the exam. Also, pay attention to the chapters on preparation for the practical exam in programming. They will give you a good idea of the level of difficulty of the exam and the types of tasks that you need to learn to solve.\nIf the tasks from the book and the preparation examples are hard for you, then you need more preparation. Enroll for the free course in \"Programming Basics\" or go through the book carefully one more time, without skipping solving the problems in any of the studied topics! You must learn how to solve them with ease without helping yourselves with the guidelines and the sample solutions.\nThe SoftUni curriculum for software engineers\nWhat follows after the entrance exam is a serious curriculum in the SoftUni program for training software engineers. It is formed as a sequence of modules in several courses in programming and software technologies, entirely directed towards gaining fundamental knowledge in software development and acquiring practical skills for working as a programmer with the most contemporary software technologies. Students are given a choice between several professions and specializations focused on C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and other languages and technologies. Each profession is studied in several modules with 4 months duration, and each module consists of 2 or 3 courses. The classes are divided into theoretical preparation (30%) and practical exercises, projects, and classes (70%), and each course ends with a practical exam or practical academic project.\nHow many hours per day does the training take?\nThe training for software engineers at SoftUni is a serious occupation and you need to spend it at least 4-5 hours every day, preferably your entire attention and time. Combining working and learning is not always successful, but if your work is less demanding and you have a lot of spare time, it is a good option. SoftUni is an appropriate option for school students, university students, and people who work in another field, but it is best if you assign your entire time to your training and mastering the profession. It will not work out if you spend 2 or 4 hours a week on it!\nThe forms of training at SoftUni are on-site (the better choice) and online (if you don't have another option). In both forms of training, to learn the program in the curriculum (that is required by software companies for starting a job), you need a lot of learning. You need to find the time for it! Reason #1 for having a hard time on the road to the profession in SoftUni is not spending enough time for the training: as a minimum, you need to spend at least 20-30 hours a week.\nSoftUni for people who work and study\nWe recommend to everyone who gets excellent score at the SoftUni entrance exam, and are passionate about making programming their profession, to leave the rest of their commitments aside and spend their entire time on learning the profession of a \"software engineer\" and start making a living from it.\n\nFor people who work, this means quitting their job (and getting a loan or decreasing their expenses to live with a lower income for 1-2 years until they start working in the new profession).\nFor people who study at a traditional university, this means to move significantly their focus towards programming and the practical courses in SoftUni, by decreasing the time spent in the traditional university.\nFor unemployed people, this is an excellent chance to assign their entire time, power, and energy to acquire a new, perspective, well paid and highly sought profession that will give them good life quality and long-term prosperity.\nFor students in secondary schools and high-schools this means giving a priority to what is more important in their development: studying practical programming in SoftUni, that will give them a profession and a job, or giving their full attention to the traditional education system, or combining smartly both undertakings. Unfortunately, often priorities are determined by parents, and we don't have a solution for these cases.\n\nWe recommend to all who cannot get an excellent score at the SoftUni entrance exam to spend more time on better learning, understanding, and most of all, practicing the material studied in the present book. If you cannot easily solve the problems in this book, you will not be able to cope with programming and software development in the future. \nDo not skip the programming basics! Do not under any circumstances make bold decisions and quit your job or the traditional university, making great plans for your future profession of a software engineer, if you don't have an excellent grade at the SoftUni entrance exam! It measures if programming is suitable for you, to what extent you like it and if you are motivated to study it seriously, and work this for years every day with joy and pleasure.\nStudy software engineering in yYour own way\nAnother possibility to develop after this book is to continue studying programming outside of SoftUni. You can enroll or subscribe to video training that goes into more details in programming with Java or other languages and development platforms. You can read books on programming and software technologies, follow online tutorials and other online resources – there are plenty of free materials on the Internet. However, keep in mind that the most important thing about the profession of a programmer is to do practical projects!\nYou cannot become a programmer without a lot of code writing and intense practicing. Allocate sufficient time to it. You cannot become a programmer for a month or two. On the Internet, you will find a wide variety of free resources, such as books, manuals, video lessons, online and on-site courses on programming and software development. However, you need to invest at least a year or two to acquire the foundation level needed for starting a job.\nAfter you gain some experience, find a way to start an internship in a company (which will be almost impossible unless you'd spent at least a year of intense code writing before that) or come up with your own practical project, on which you need to spend a few months, even a year, in order to learn based on the trial-and-error principle.\n\nKeep in mind that there are many ways to become a programmer, but they all have something in common: intense code writing and years of practice!\n\n\nRecommended resources for developers\nA huge amount of resources is available on the Web for developers: online trainings, courses, tutorials, books, interactive training sites, etc.\nWe can not mention all of them because they change over time and because the list might be huge. What we recommend is to join the developer communities in your region, because this will help you a lot when you study.\nOnline communities for beginners in programming\nRegardless of the path, you have chosen, if you are seriously involved in programming, we recommend subscribing to specialized online forums, discussion groups, and communities, from which you can get assistance from your colleagues and track the novelties in the software industry.\nIf you will study programming seriously surround yourselves with people who are involved in programming seriously. Join communities of software developers, attend software conferences, go to events for programmers, find friends with whom you can talk about programming, discuss problems and bugs, find an environment that can help you. In most large towns, there are free events for programmers a few times a week. In smaller localities, you have the Internet and access to the entire online community.\nHere are some recommended resources that will be useful for your development as a programmer:\n\nhttps://softuni.org – official website of SoftUni. In it, you will find free (and not only) courses, seminars, video tutorials, and training in programming, software technologies, and digital competencies.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/softuni.org – official Facebook page of SoftUni. By it, you will learn about new courses, seminars, and events related to programming and software development.\nhttps://introprogramming.info – official website of the books \"Programming Basics\" with C# and Java by Dr. Svetlin Nakov and his team. The books examine in-depth programming basics, basic data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and other basic skills and are an excellent continuation for reading after the current book. However, besides reading, you need to do intense code writing, do not forget that!\nhttps://stackoverflow.com – Stack Overflow is one of the widest discussion forums for programmers worldwide, where you will find assistance for any possible question in the world of programming. If you are fluent in English, look up at StackOverflow and ask your questions there.\nhttps://www.udemy.com – Udemy is one of the biggest marketplaces for technical training, offered free or at affordable prices.\nhttps://www.meetup.com/find/tech/ – look for tech meetups around your city and involve in communities that you like. Most of the tech meetups are free, and newbies are welcome.\n\nGood luck to all!\nOn behalf of the entire authors' team, we wish you endless success in the profession and in your life! We will be really happy, if with our help you are passionate about programming and we have inspired you to boldly take up the profession of \"software engineer\", which will: bring you a good job, working with pleasure, quality life, and prosperity, as well as great perspectives for development and possibilities for making impressive projects with inspiration and passion.\nSofia, December 5, 2017\n"}}}
